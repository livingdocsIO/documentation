## Livingdocs npm packages

The Livingdocs core is distributed via private npm packages.
As a customer, you can get a token to access them and install them in your custom projects:

```
@livingdocs/framework
@livingdocs/server
@livingdocs/editor
@livingdocs/livingdocs-cli
```

## Core APIs

Both the core server and the editor npm package expose an API when required

- [Editor core API]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/editor/editor-api" >}})
- [Server core API]({{< ref "/customising/server/data-source-api" >}})

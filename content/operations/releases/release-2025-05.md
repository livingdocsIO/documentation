### Removal of Desk-Net in favor to Kordiam :fire:

Desk-Net rebranded as Kordiam.
To align Livingdocs with this change, we previously introduced corresponding Kordiam properties, features, and plugins.
With this release, we are removing the superseded Desk-Net functionality:

- Feature `li-desknet` and `li-desknet-`integration, including all server APIs
- Server config `desknet`, `integrations.desknet`, and `hugo.print.desknetMetadataFields`
- Project config `settings.desknet`, `settings.integrations.desknet`, and `contentTypes.[*].desknet`
- Function parameter `desknetApi` of Desk-Net/Kordiam functions
- `desknet` property in the return objects of `projectApi.getProject()` and `systemApi.config()`
- Metadata plugins `li-desknet-global`, `li-desknet-integration`, and `li-desknet-schedule`
- li-kordiam-schedule config property `desknetExternalElementIdMetadataPath`
- TODO: @marcbachmann -> API urls changes?

{{< feature-info "Server" "Removal" >}}

### Removal of Menu Tool :fire:

The Menu Tool has been removed.

- Menu items `{liItem: 'menus'}` are no longer supported. Please remove them from the project config.
- Public API GET `/api/:apiVersion/menus/:channelHandle?` has been removed.
- Feature `li-menus` has been removed including all its server APIs.

{{< feature-info "Server" "Removal" >}}

### Removal of config.contentTypes :fire:

The deprecated shorthand property `config.contentTypes` in the li-document-search metadata plugin was now removed.
Use `config.contentType` instead.

## Deprecations

There have been no deprecations since the last release.

## Features

{{< feature-info "Exposure Boosting" "server/editor" >}}

### Exposure Boosting :gift:

When using algorithmic teasers, the order of the documents is determined by a sort criteria. Oftentimes, this is the latest publication date.
By activating the exposure boost for a document, it will appear before all non-boosted documents returned by an algorithm.
This is useful, in scenarios where algorithms receive high frequency updates and important topics would get pushed down quickly.
The effect will go away automatically after a certain time.

1. Add the `li-exposure-boost` plugin to your content type metadata

   ```js
   {
     handle: 'article',
     // ...
     metadata: [
       // ...
       {
         handle: 'exposureBoost',
         type: 'li-exposure-boost',
         config: {
           index: true
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   - **handle**: Make sure to use the same handle for all content types where the plugin is configured
   - **indexing**: The config option `index` needs to be enabled for it to work

2. Generally allow exposure boosting for certain teasers in their service params schema

   ```js
   {
     name: 'someTeaserService',
     paramsSchema: [
       // ...
       {
         handle: 'someTeaser',
         type: 'li-teaser',
         config: {
           // ...
           algorithm: {
             // ...
             allowExposureBoost: true
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Show the exposure boost UI on a Table Dashboard (optional)
   ```js
   {
     handle: 'someDashboard',
     // ...
     columns: [
       // ...
       {
         label: 'Boost',
         minWidth: 100,
         growFactor: 0,
         priority: 1,
         metadataPropertyName: 'exposureBoost',
         editable: true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2025-32442](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc) patched in `fastify` v5.3.2

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

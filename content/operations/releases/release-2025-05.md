## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes 🔥

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server" >}}

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

TODO: check migration

## Deprecations

## Features

{{< feature-info "Exposure Boosting" "server/editor" >}}

### Exposure Boosting :gift:

When using algorithmic teasers, the order of the documents is determined by a sort criteria. Oftentimes, this is the latest publication date.
By activating the exposure boost for a document, it will appear before all non-boosted documents returned by an algorithm.
This is useful, in scenarios where algorithms receive high frequency updates and important topics would get pushed down quickly.
The effect will go away automatically after a certain time.

1. Add the `li-exposure-boost` plugin to your content type metadata

   ```js
   {
     handle: 'article',
     // ...
     metadata: [
       // ...
       {
         handle: 'exposureBoost',
         type: 'li-exposure-boost',
         config: {
           index: true
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - **handle**: Make sure to use the same handle for all content types where the plugin is configured
   - **indexing**: The config option `index` needs to be enabled for it to work

2. Generally allow exposure boosting for certain teasers in their service params schema
   ```js
   {
     name: 'someTeaserService',
     paramsSchema: [
       // ...
       {
         handle: 'someTeaser',
         type: 'li-teaser',
         config: {
           // ...
           algorithm: {
             // ...
             allowExposureBoost: true
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Show the exposure boost UI on a Table Dashboard (optional)
   ```js
   {
     handle: 'someDashboard',
     // ...
     columns: [
       // ...
       {
         label: 'Boost',
         minWidth: 100,
         growFactor: 0,
         priority: 1,
         metadataPropertyName: 'exposureBoost',
         editable: true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:

- TBD

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

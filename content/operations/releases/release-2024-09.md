## Deployment

### Before the deployment

No prior preparations (besides `livingdocs-server migrate up`) are required before rolling out this release.

### After the deployment

No preparations are required after rolling out this release.

### Rollback

Only rollback if you have a critical issue with the release in question. Usually forward patching is the better option.

If you need to rollback the release, you can do so by running the following command on the Livingdocs Server running the new release:

```sh
livingdocs-server migrate down
```

All document inbox entries added after the release deployment are lost when you do a rollback.

## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server" >}}
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 201-inbox-mutations.js
#   creates a copy of table document_inbox named document_inbox_v2, adapts scripts to use the new table (related to feature Document Inbox)
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Migrate `document_inbox` table to `document_inbox_v2` :fire:

This release we are migrating `document_inbox` to a new postgres table as the data structure is changing.
By migrating to the new table we can ensure a release rollback can be done more easily.
However, be aware that all changes done to the inbox while running the system on `release-2024-09` are lost when performing a rollback and the data before the update is restored!

### Redirect URLs `/p/{projectHandle}/articles/{documentId}/*` to `/p/{projectHandle}/document/{documentId}`

All URLs of the form `/p/{projectHandle}/articles/{documentId}/*` will redirect to their corresponding `/p/{projectHandle}/document/{documentId}/*` URL. If a corresponding URL no longer exists, the URLs will redirect to the main URL `/p/{projectHandle}/document/{documentId}` and the associated action will no longer work.

## Deprecations

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server/editor" >}}
### NodeJS 18 :warning:

Support for NodeJS v18 will be removed in `release-2025-01`. Please upgrade your docker images and local environments to node v20 or v22. 

In your docker images change:
`FROM livingdocs/server-base:18 to FROM livingdocs/server-base:22` or `FROM livingdocs/server-base:18 to FROM livingdocs/server-base:20`
`FROM livingdocs/editor-base:18 to FROM livingdocs/editor-base:22` or `FROM livingdocs/editor-base:18 to FROM livingdocs/editor-base:20`
`FROM livingdocs/node:18 to FROM livingdocs/node:22` or `FROM livingdocs/node:18 to FROM livingdocs/node:20`

In your .nvmrc (if present) change the string from 18 to 22 or 20.

## Features

### Document Inbox :gift:

In a newsroom's editorial workflow, the tasks of creating articles and placing them on a page are often divided among different roles.
The document inbox is a tool that allows an article to be sent to a pageâ€™s inbox.
The person responsible for managing the page can then organize the articles within the inbox using groups,
and finally drag the article to a specific spot on the page.

Configuring the inbox is part of the content type configuration, in this case, for a page.
By referencing a table dashboard using a handle, it's possible to control which columns are displayed for an article entry in the inbox:

```js
// Content Type Config
{
 handle: 'page',
 documentType: 'page',
 inbox: {
   useDashboardColumns: 'inboxDashboard', // Specifies the dashboard columns to use for the documents in the inbox
   contentTypes: ['article'], // Added in release-2024-09 
   mediaTypes: ['image'] // Pre-existing; allows media library entries in the inbox as well
 }
}
```

Further details can be found on the [content type documentation page]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#document-inbox" >}}).


### Copy & Transform flows :gift:



### Document Info Panel :gift:



### Document Editing Header and Toolbar :gift:



### Space optimisation for side panels :gift:

The width of the wide side panels (e.g., Media Library) has been increased on large screens to provide additional space. On screens wider than 1920px, these panels will have a width of 800px. On smaller screens, the width remains unchanged at 600px.

Teaser side panels and the Document Inbox have been changed to wide side panels. They now follow the same behavior as described above: 600px on smaller screens and 800px on larger screens.

{{< img src="./release-2024-09-wide-side-panels.png" alt="Screenshot of a wide teaser side panel" >}}

If users notice overlapping components that negatively affect their experience, please contact your CSO manager.

### Dashboards: search caching behaviour :gift:



### Push Message Proposals :gift:



### Content Validation Errors :gift:



### Table dashboards: Direct publish without safeguard :gift:



### Retresco support for main entities :gift:

Retresco has introduced a new concept of main entities. These are entities identified by Retresco that are particularly relevant to a document (i.e., they have a high score). To support this new concept, we have extended our storage schema for Retresco entities to include an indicator `isMain` of whether an entity is a main entity and also report this data back to Retresco.

No changes are required for main entities to work, other than enabling main entities in Retresco. Currently, main entities are not marked in the Livingdocs UI. They appear as regular entities.

### iMatrics test environment support :gift:

To support iMatrics test environments, we are adding a new iMatrics project configuration property to specify whether the iMatrics test environment should be used. By default, it is set to `false`.

```js
integrations: {
  imatrics: {
    testEnvironment: true
  }
}
```

### `li-system-text` metadata plugin :gift:

This release a new system metadata plugin becomes available: `li-system-text`. `li-system-text` is a simple text value store that behaves like `li-text`, but belongs to the system metadata.

It can be used in cases where a simple text value should be stored in the metadata, but the document version should not
be increased when the metadata value changes. Or in other words, it will not show up as unpublished change.

Please note that it is only available as document metadata, no other contexts.

Further details can be found on the [plugin documentation page](({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-system-text" >}})).

### Desknet -> Kordiam editor UI updates :gift:

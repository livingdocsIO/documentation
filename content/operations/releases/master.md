## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

### Deliveries: Status and Build Triggers

For infinite products like an e-paper there is usually a "build" stage involved. With the new Deliveries feature we allow a customer to trigger a remote system to kick off a build and report the status of the build back to Livingdocs. This allows an editor to get a better view on the infinite product life cycle. These are the features:

- Trigger a build of a remote build system in the Publish Control view
- Get an overview of the build state in the Publish Control view
- Allow a remote build system to report its status back to Livingdocs

* [Guide TODO]({{< ref "/guides/editor/document-creation-flow" >}})
* [PR: Server Config + Webhook + Events](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4670)

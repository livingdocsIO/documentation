## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

TODO: add db migrations

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Upgrade cheerio to 1.0.0-rc.12 :fire:

This change only affects customers using a customized render pipeline or the hugo feature and if you have `cheerio` in your package.json.

- `cheerio.load` behaves slightly different and automatically appends '<html><body>' tags. Please follow the upgrade instruction from cheerio https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio#loading.
- Newlines `\r\n` now get normalized to `\n`.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5063)


### Drop Imagemagick support :fire:

The usage of it was discouraged since a long time because of security issues.
Remove the server config property `mediaLibrary.images.processingStrategy`.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5095)


### Remove Dashboard Display Filters :fire:

These Dashboard Display Filters are not supported anymore:
- `coreApi.searchFilters.register`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerList`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerAngularComponent`

Update the deprecated filter to the supported [Display Filters](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter/) from the core.
- Named Filters
- Metadata Filters
- ListV2 Filters

If you can't handle your requirements with core filters it's best to contact your Customer Solutions manager to get inputs for solutions (one option is to create your custom Vue component, but that should be prevented whenever possible).

References:
- [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6166)
- [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6136)

### Remove Editor Config appConfig.app.sidePanelItems :fire:

The Editor Config `appConfig.app.sidePanelItems` is removed, move the config to the Project Config `editorSettings.mainNavigation`.

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)


## Deprecations

### Deprecate appConfig.ui.welcome

The editor config `appConfig.ui.welcome` is deprecated and will be removed in `release-2023-03`.

- Option 2: Switch to a [Home Screen]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#home-screen" >}})

Breaking Change: `release-2023-03`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)


### Deprecate Display Filter config for category

The Display Filter of a metadata property of type `li-category` should be reconfigured as `{metadataPropertyName: 'category'}`

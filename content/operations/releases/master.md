## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

### Fix firstPublicationDate to documents table (Post Deployment) :fire:

This script was backported to release-2022-11, so it has been added again for release-2023-01 in case anyone missed it. If you already ran the script with the previous release upgrade you do not need to run it again.

If you have unpublished a document while running release-2022-07 or release-2022-09 then you may have inaccurate values for the `document.systemdata.firstPublicationDate`. Below is a comparison of the change in the four most recent versions:

First publish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Set `firstPublicationDate`

Republish while published:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Keep `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Remove `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Republish after unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Essentially the old behaviour and the new "fixed" behaviour is to set `firstPublicationDate` once and never modify it. This property will still exist even when the document is unpublished. For release-2022-07 and release-2022-09 the difference in behaviour was that the `firstPublicationDate` would be cleared on unpublish and set again at the next publish.

If you would like to correct the `firstPublicationDate` property for all of your articles you can run:
```bash
node ./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/009-fix-first-publication-date.js
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Check that `first_publication_id` has been set (same as the script 007-populate-first-publication-data.js)
2. Move `firstPublicationDate` from `data` to `data.publishControl`
3. Remove `data.firstPublicationDate`
4. If `firstPublicationDate` is not set then use the value from the first publication
5. If `firstPublicationDate` is set then use the value from the first publication when the first publication is older

It is highly recommended that you run this script because it is performing a data migration as well as fixing the values.

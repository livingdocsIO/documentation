### Livingdocs Server

- TBD

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `main` branch) is at your own risk

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:

- TBD

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2022-25844](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m2h2-264f-f486), [CVE-2022-25869](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prc3-vjfx-vhm9), [CVE-2023-26116](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2vrf-hf26-jrp5), [CVE-2023-26117](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2qqx-w9hr-q5gx), [CVE-2023-26118](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qwqh-hm9m-p5hr), [CVE-2024-8372](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m9gf-397r-hwpg), [CVE-2024-8373](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqm9-c95h-x2p6), [CVE-2024-21490](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w4v-5hc9-xrr2), [CVE-2025-0716](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j58c-ww9w-pwp5) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.
- [CVE-2024-9506](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j4c-8p2g-v4jx) vulnerability in `vue`, an ReDoS vulnerability exploitable through inefficient regex evaluation in parseHTML function. The issue can cause excessive CPU usage but is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted HTML at runtime.

## Deprecations

{{< feature-info "Design" "editor" >}}
### Sass `@import` declarations are deprecated

In the Livingdocs editor, it is possible to declare an additional stylesheet. This can be done using an environment variable, such as:

```
CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER=./path/to/custom.scss
```

When this variable is set, the editor uses the specified custom Sass/CSS file.

If your project defines such a custom stylesheet, you are likely using `@import` declarations within it. However, a recent Sass update has deprecated the `@import` syntax. To prevent warnings and ensure compatibility, these `@import` statements need to be migrated.

##### Migration Guide

Follow these guidelines to migrate your `@import` statements:

1. **For files exposing variables, replace `@import` with `@use`:**

   ```scss
   @use "~styles/settings/defaults";

   .custom-style {
     // Use variables from the imported file, prefixed by the file name
     z-index: defaults.$z-index-modal;
   }
   ```

   This replaces the previous approach:

   ```scss
   @import "~styles/settings/defaults";

   .custom-style {
     z-index: $z-index-modal;
   }
   ```

   **Note:** The `@use` directive automatically namespaces variables with the file name (e.g., `defaults.$variableName`), which helps avoid naming conflicts.

2. **For other cases, replace `@import` with `@forward`:**

   ```scss
   @forward "~styles/settings/defaults";
   ```

   Use `@forward` to re-export the contents of a file without directly consuming them in the current file.

##### Why This Change?

The Sass team deprecated `@import` because it does not enforce proper scoping, leading to potential variable and mixin conflicts in larger projects. The new directives `@use` and `@forward` are designed to ensure better modularity and maintainability in your stylesheets.

For more details, refer to the [Sass official documentation on deprecating `@import`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import).

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2024-55565](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mwcw-c2x4-8c55) patched in `nanoid`. 
* [CVE-2024-45813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45813) patched in `find-my-way` v8.2.2

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes 🔥

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server" >}}
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

TODO: check migration

## Features

TODO (featureset not 100% defined yet)

{{< feature-info "Project configuration" "server" >}}
### Allow `contentType.defaultComponents` config :gift:

Configuration `contentType.defaultComponents` has been added to the [project configuration]({{< ref "reference/project-config/content-types" >}}). This configuration allows you to define default components for a content type. The default components will be added to the document when the content type is selected. The default components are added to the end of the document.

```js
contentTypes: [
  {
    handle: 'gallery',
    documentType: 'article',
    defaultComponents: {
      paragraph: 'p',
      image: 'img',
      video: 'video',
      audio: 'audio',
      html: 'html'
    }
  }
]
```

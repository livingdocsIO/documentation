## Highlights

### Revoke Media

The new "revoke media" functionality in the media library allows users to delete media files from storage instead of archiving them. This can be useful in situations such as handling requests to completely removing media for legal reasons.
Customers have different requirements for what should happen after revoking an image, like
- remove revoked images from documents
- clearing caches
- sending an email notification
Therefore we provide a server event and a webhook, both named `mediaLibraryEntry.revoke`, which the downstream server can subscribe to.

### Responsive Editing Toolbar :tada:

With the introduction of more an more actions in the Document Editing Toolbar, space was getting rare, especially on smaller screens. Therefore a responsive editing toolbar has been introduced which collapse actions to groups when there is not enough space.

### Restricted Users :tada:

It's now possible to define a user group with "Restricted Users". Restricted users can only see their own documents and assets. This can be useful if you have external editors (freelancer).

### Improve Keyboard Navigation and Viewport Focus in Editor (more Word like behavior) :tada:

You can now use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate between different text components. The cursor position is maintained, so that the editor can always get back to where she started after navigating around. The viewport scrolls automatically if the cursor hits positions outside of the viewport. The same applies to navigation between comments in a document. The behavior is now much more in line with common text processors such as Microsoft Word.

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the database

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database scheme
# migration - 166-add-media-library-state.js
#   add row state to the table media_library_entries
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Remove support for callbacks in multiple server API's :fire:

We removed Callback support in several server API's as we noticed many bugs originating from mixing callbacks and promises. So we continue to phase out callbacks in all APIs. In the next releases we will continue with the removal of callbacks in server API's. All server API's already support Promises, therefore you can prepare the downstream migration from Callbacks to Promises.

- 🔥 remove callback support for designLoaderApi (`server.features.api('li-design-loader')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for registrationApi (`server.features.api('li-registration')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for documentRelationApi (`server.features.api('li-document-relations')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for desknetIntegrationApi (`server.features.api('li-desknet-integration')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for documentCopyApi (`server.features.api('li-document-copy')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for designStatsApi (`server.features.api('li-design-stats')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for tasksApi (`server.features.api('li-tasks')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for designsApi (`server.features.api('li-designs')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for cacheApi (`server.features.api('li-cache')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for includesApi (`server.features.api('li-includes')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for publicApi (`server.features.api('li-public-api')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for importApi (`server.features.api('li-import')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for documentListApi (`server.features.api('li-document-lists')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for migrationApi (`server.features.api('li-migrations')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for emailApi (`server.features.api('li-emails')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support for routingApi (`server.features.api('li-routing')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported


#### Example how to migrate

Search e.g. for `li-design-loader` and replace all your code from a callback to a promise based approach (async/await). Please also consider your tests.

```js
// from
const designLoaderApi = liServer.features.api('li-design-loader')
designLoaderApi.loadConfig({
  name: req.params.name,
  version: req.params.version,
  projectId
}, (err, designConfig) => {
  if (err) return callback(err)
  // ...
})

// to
const designLoaderApi = liServer.features.api('li-design-loader')
const designConfig = await designLoaderApi.loadConfig({
  name: req.params.name,
  version: req.params.version,
  projectId
})
```

If you have a lot of code with callbacks and it's difficult to migrate everything in one step, you can use Livingdocs `callbackify` function to migrate the functions step by step. If you have transformed one function e.g. `fetchTargetChannel` into a promise based function and have a lot of callback functions which are calling `fetchTargetChannel`, you can use `callbackify`. `callbackify` transforms a promise into a callback.

```js
// original function with callback
function fetchTargetChannel (projectId, callback) {
  const projectApi = liServer.features.api('li-projects').project
  projectApi.getProject(projectId, (err, project) => {
    if (err) return callback(err)
    const targetChannel = project.channels.find(
      (channel) => channel.channelHandle === AUTHORS_CHANNEL_HANDLE)
    callback(null, targetChannel)
  })
}

// step 1 - transform the function into a promise, but callbackify the function as long as it's called by other callback functions
const callbackify = require('@livingdocs/server/exports').callbackify

async function fetchTargetChannel (projectId, callback) {
  // add this line to callbackify the promise
  if (callback) return callbackify.method(fetchTargetChannel, callback, [projectId])

  const projectApi = liServer.features.api('li-projects').project
  const project = await projectApi.getProject(projectId)
  const targetChannel = project.channels.find(
    (channel) => channel.channelHandle === AUTHORS_CHANNEL_HANDLE)
  return targetChannel
}

// step 2 - remove callbackify when everything is transformed into promises properly
async function fetchTargetChannel (projectId) {
  const projectApi = liServer.features.api('li-projects').project
  const project = await projectApi.getProject(projectId)
  const targetChannel = project.channels.find(
    (channel) => channel.channelHandle === AUTHORS_CHANNEL_HANDLE)
  return targetChannel
}
```

### Do not support callbacks in includes anymore (removed rendering.function) :fire:

🔥 removed `rendering.function` (callback) support in includes. Use `rendering.render` (promise) instead. (Tip: search for `rendering: {` to find potentially affected functions)

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3872)


### Remove support for worker-farm and worker-nodes strategies :fire:

There is no worker strategy available and settable anymore for the migration and render pipeline feature. All migrations are computed in the same process (formerly known as `in-process` strategy)

🔥 You can't set a worker strategy anymore. Remove all server config settings at `migration.worker_strategy` and `render_pipeline.worker_strategy`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3821)


### Upgrade from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5 :fire:


In case you have a [karma test setup](https://karma-runner.github.io/) (if `karma.js` file is present in your project root), you'll need to update the configurations.
`istanbul-instrumenter-loader` got replaced by `babel-plugin-istanbul` and `karma-coverage`.

Please remove all webpack dependencies and install the new versions for it:
```bash
npm uninstall webpack karma-webpack karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter
npm install --save-dev webpack@latest karma-webpack@latest karma-coverage@latest
```

Then change the coverage reporter in the `karma.js` configuration:
```diff
- const webpackRules = webpackConfig.module.rules
-
- webpackRules.unshift({
-   test: /\.(js)$/,
-   exclude: /(\/(node_modules|test|vendor|dist|bundle|coverage|config)\/|\.spec\.js$)/,
-   use: {
-    loader: 'istanbul-instrumenter-loader',
-     options: {
-       esModules: true
-     }
-   }
- })

 ...
     plugins: [
-       'karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter',
+       'karma-coverage',
         ....
    ],

-     coverageIstanbulReporter: {
-        dir: './coverage',
-        reports: ['lcov']
+     coverageReporter: {
+       dir: 'coverage',
+       reporters: [
+         {type: 'lcov', subdir: 'lcov'},
+         {type: 'text-summary', subdir: '.'}
+       ]

-     reporters: ['super-dots', 'mocha', 'coverage-istanbul']
+     reporters: ['super-dots', 'mocha', 'coverage']
```

### Dashboard Card Configuration :fire:

:fire: Removed project config `editorSettings.mediaLibrary.dashboard.displayFilters`. Move `editorSettings.mediaLibrary.dashboard.displayFilters` config to `mediaType.editor.dashboard.displayFilters` on the relevant mediaType configs.

:fire: Media Type Dashboard configuration

If you configure both `mediaType.editor.dashboard` (the dashboard opened in modals and through the document editing toolbar) and `mediaType.editor.managementDashboard` (the dashboard opened through the main navigation), the config used for the `managementDashboard` is compiled from the `dashboard` config and the `managementDashboard` config by overwriting on a top-level property level. Before, if `managementDashboard` was configured, the `dashboard` configuration was completely ignored.

Example:

```js
// behaviour before this change: management dashboard would not contain a displayFilter
// behaviour after this change: management dashboard contains the displayFilter configured in dashboard
mediaType.editor: {
  dashboard: {
    displayFilters: [{filterName: 'myFilter'}]
  },
  managementDashboard: {
    baseFilters: [{filterName: 'myBaseFilter'}]
  }
}
```

To get the old behavior, configure like this:

```js
mediaType.editor: {
  dashboard: {
    displayFilters: [{filterName: 'myFilter'}]
  },
  managementDashboard: {
    baseFilters: [{filterName: 'myBaseFilter'}],
    displayFilters: []
  }
}
```

### Remove File Feature :fire:

- 🔥 Removed core feature `li-files`
- 🔥 Removed server API `liServer.features.api('li-files')`
- 🔥 Removed editing API `/files/upload`, use POST `/media-library/upload-file` instead

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3643)


### Always activate copy component feature :fire:

🔥 Remove editor config `copy.componentCopyEnabled`. The setting has no effect anymore, component copy is always enabled.

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/4476)


### Show insert component filter if there are more than 8 components :fire:

🔥 Remove editor config `app.editor.insertPanel.useAdvancedComponentGroups`. The setting has no effect anymore. The filter on the insert panel is always shown if there are more than 8 components.

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/4477)


### Data-Migration: remove callback support :fire:

🔥 The callback-based function `migrate` has been removed for a file data-migration. Use the promise based function `migrateAsync` instead.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3819)


### Fix JSON patch operation of MediaLibraryEntries :fire:

We had some invalid data structures when an asset in the media library got replaced.

#### Required action for downstreams :fire:

In case you had the replaceAsset functionality enabled, you might want to fix invalid data structures. To check whether there are existing archived assets, please execute that query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM media_library_entries
WHERE data->'archivedAssets' IS NOT NULL;
```

In case you have broken assets, please execute the following migration.
We didn't put it into a new migration as the migration could block for too long.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION li_jsonb_extract_nested_image_objects(val jsonb, obj jsonb)
RETURNS jsonb
LANGUAGE plpgsql
IMMUTABLE
AS $$
DECLARE
  key text;
BEGIN
  IF jsonb_typeof(val) != 'object' THEN RETURN obj; END IF;
  IF val->'key' IS NOT NULL THEN RETURN obj || jsonb_build_object(val->>'key', val); END IF;
  FOR key IN SELECT * FROM jsonb_object_keys(val) LOOP
    obj := li_jsonb_extract_nested_image_objects(val->key, obj);
  END LOOP;
  RETURN obj;
END;
$$;

UPDATE media_library_entries
SET data = data || jsonb_build_object('archivedAssets', li_jsonb_extract_nested_image_objects(data->'archivedAssets', '{}'))
WHERE data->'archivedAssets' IS NOT NULL;
```

### Typography Cleanup :fire:

If you have any custom UI in your downstream that makes use of any of the following you want to read this:

classes:
- `.alpha`, `.beta`, `.gamma`, `.delta`, `.epsilon`, `.zeta`
- `.smallprint`, `.milli`, `.micro`, `.dense`
- `.text--milli`, `.text--micro`
- `.text--black`

SCSS variabales / mixins:
- `$base-font-size`, `$base-line-height`, `$h1-size`, `$h2-size`, `$h3-size`, `$h4-size`, `$h5-size`, `$h6-size`, `$milli-size`, `$micro-size`, `$line-height-ratio`
- `font-size($font-size, $line-height: true)`
- `headings($from: 1, $to: 6)`

You are highly encouraged to refactor your markup / custom stylesheets to not use these things anymore. In order to ease that process, there is a file you can `@import` in your custom SCSS to get support for the mentioned classes and variables:
In the SCSS file you have configured as `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE` or `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER` add this line at the top:
```sass
@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2021-09.scss";
```
This will define the removed classes, variables and mixins within your SCSS file tree. Your Sass files will compile again and your custom UI will most probably look just fine. From there on you can refactor your code and remove the `@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2021-09.scss";` after you are done. We will keep this file around for some time, but it will eventually get removed.

If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to contact us.
You can also consult the styleguide to read more about newly introduced styles and how they look.

## Deprecations

### Document List Card Extension

editor config  are deprecated in favor of project config editorSettings.documentList.dashboard:

🔧  Deprecate editor config `app.filters.documentListList` and projectConfig `settings.lists`. Move config to server config `editorSettings.documentLists.dashboard`

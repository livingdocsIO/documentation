### Vue Metadata Plugins

A much requested feature was adding metadata plugins with a custom Vue component. Finally we have it!

References:
* [Guide - Slug example implementation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/documents/metadata/metadata-examples/)
* [Documentation - List of available metadata plugins](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins)
* [Documentation - Register a metadata plugin via Vue component registry](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/advanced/editor/vue-component-registry)

### Table Dashboards

Table dashboards are a new flexible type of dashboards where individual columns can be configured.
This release contains a first iteration, the full functionality will be provided with the next release.

The following functionality is available in this release:
* Basic configuration of table dashboards (main menu entry, filters, column layout)
* Display and inline editing for these metadata properties: `li-text`, `li-boolean`, `li-category`, `li-document-reference`
* Default column component that displays document thumbnail and title
* Custom components can be configured to render the content of a table cell

The following functionality will be added in the next release:
* Table dashboard used as default for articles, pages, and data records
* Document creation from a table dashboard
* New filter configuration
* Inline editing of more metadata properties

* [Support for li-category / li-document-reference](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5043)

### Retresco integration

We integrated `Retresco` tagging system to automatically add tags to a document with a nice UI. The supported functionality is:
- automated adding of tags (via Retresco) to a Livingdocs document
- ability to change tags via Editor

### Video Includes

Video includes provide a more flexible approach to embedding videos within a document than using the standard media library entry directly. The media library approach does not have an integrated solution for video transcoding, so it would only be possible to render the original video file to HTML. On the other hand, using an include service allows you to hook into an external service or data store which could provide the transcoded assets you require.

  * [Video reference form upload](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/4823)

### oEmbed Include

The oEmbed include service allows users to embed content (such as photos, videos, or iframes) by providing a link to a resource, without having to worry about embed scripts. The include service has a small number of core providers (TikTok, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube), but it can easily be extended with additional providers, or with a generic catch-all provider.

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration - 173-add-user-ids-to-document-lists.js
# migration - 174-add-range-query-functions.js
# migration - 175-drop-documents-content-type-document-type-and-channel.js
# migration - 176-publish-control.js
# migration - 177-document_revisions-document_id-deferrable.js
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Remove Support for Postgres 9 + 10 :fire:

:fire: Support for Postgres 9 + 10 has been removed, Please Update to Postgres 14 (11+ is supported).

### Migrate knex transactions to pg :fire:

💣  The knex instance on `liServer.db.connection` is deprecated
:fire: Knex transactions aren't compatible with Livingdocs anymore. Please use `db.begin` instead:

```js
const db = liServer.db
liServer.db.begin(async (trx) => {
  db.sql`UPDATE something set foo = 'bar'`.transacting(trx)
  // or
  await trx.sql`UPDATE something set foo = 'bar'`
})
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4163)

### Remove columns from documents / document_publication_events table :fire:

💣 Remove `metadata_id`, `channel_id`, `content_type` and `document_type` columns from the `documents` table
💣 Remove `channel_id`, `content_type` and `document_type` columns from the `document_publication_events` table

Those changes shouldn't affect any downstream, but in case there are direct sql queries against the database, you need to switch to queries that use the `content_type_id` column.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4165)


### Remove support for callbacks in multiple server API's :fire:

We removed Callback support in several server API's as we noticed many bugs originating from mixing callbacks and promises. So we continue to phase out callbacks in all APIs. In the next releases we will continue with the removal of callbacks in server API's. All server API's already support Promises, therefore you can prepare the downstream migration from Callbacks to Promises.

An example how to migrate the APIs you will find in [September 2021 Release]({{< ref "operations/releases/release-2021-09.md" >}})

- 🔥 remove callback support of `channelConfig` (`server.features.api('li-channel-configs').write`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support of `documentApi` (`server.features.api('li-documents').document`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support of `pushNotifications` (`server.features.api('li-push-notifications').publication`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support of `publicationApi` (`server.features.api('li-documents').publication`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support of `pusherApi` (`server.features.api('li-pusher-authentication')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported
- 🔥 remove callback support of `hugoApi` (`server.features.api('li-hugo')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported

### Reject registering unknown publication hooks :fire:

Until now, you were able to register a publication hook with any name, even when the hook had no effect.

🔥 Only support the registration of well-known [Publication Hooks](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/server/server-hooks/#publication-hooks)


### Remove prepublishHook :fire:

🔥 removed server hook `prepublishHook`
🔥 renamed server config `integrations.retresco.registerPrepublishHook` to `integrations.retresco.registerPreparePublishHook`

If you want to keep the functionality of the `prepublishHook`, you can use the `preparePublishHook`. For alternatives and explanations check the [Server Hooks documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/server/server-hooks/#publication-hooks)

```js
// migrate from
async prepublishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // modify documentVersion
  return {documentVersion}
}
// to
async preparePublishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // modify documentVersion
  return
}
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4257)


### Remove publishHook :fire:

🔥 removed `publishHook` (throws an error on server startup)

If you want to keep the functionality of the `publishHook`, you can use the `preparePublishHook` (modify the document) or `postPublishHook` (notify other systems). For more explanations check the [Server Hooks documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/server/server-hooks/#publication-hooks)

**Example 1 - migration from publishHook to preparePublishHook**
```js
// migrate from
async publishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // modify documentVersion
  return {documentVersion}
}
// to
async preparePublishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // modify documentVersion
  return
}
```

**Example 2 - migration from publishHook to postPublishHook**
```js
// migrate from
async publishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // notify other system
  return {documentVersion}
}
// to
async postPublishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // notify other system
  return
}
```

**Example 3 - migrate document rendering**
```js
// if you have used the document rendering in the publication hook, you can still use the functionality
// but you have to go over the publicationApi

async publishHookAsync (params) {
  const {documentVersion, renditions} = await params.render()
  await pushRenditionsToExternalService(renditions)
  return {documentVersion}
}
// to
async postPublishHookAsync (params) {
  const publicationApi = server.features.api('li-documents').publication
  const {documentVersion, renditions} = await publicationApi.render(params.documentVersion)
  await pushRenditionsToExternalService(renditions)
  return
}
```

### Rename metadata.onPublish hook to metadata.onPreparePublish hook :fire:

🔥 rename `metadata.onPublish` hook to `metadata.onPreparePublish` hook (API stays same)

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4264)

### unpublishHook parameter change :fire:

:fire: Change the parameters in `unpublishHook`.
- `params.payload.documentVersion` moved to `params.documentVersion`.
- Access of `params.payload` now throws an error

**Migration example**
```js
async unpublishHookAsync ({documentVersion}) {
  // params.payload.documentVersion moved to params.documentVersion
  await doSomething(documentVersion)
}
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4123)

### Document Inbox - remove position parameter :fire:

The `position` parameter can no longer be passed to `server.features.api('li-document-inbox').removeItem({})` or `POST /documents/:documentId/inbox-remove`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4081)

### Remove support for callbacks in projectApi :fire:

We removed Callback support in several server API's as we noticed many bugs originating from mixing callbacks and promises. So we continue to phase out callbacks in all APIs. In the next releases we will continue with the removal of callbacks in server API's. All server API's already support Promises, therefore you can prepare the downstream migration from Callbacks to Promises.

- 🔥 remove callback support for projectApi (`server.features.api('li-projects')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported

You can find migration a migration example [here]({{< ref "/operations/releases/release-2021-09.md#example-how-to-migrate" >}}).

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4160)

### Document Search - Don't search for exact document id matches :fire:

:fire: `server.features.api('li-documents').document.find()` will no longer search by id if the search string is numeric.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4155)

### Remove Support for tasks-v1 :fire:

Tasks v1 is deprecated since 2 years. We removed it, because no customers use it to our knowledge.

**Steps to do for downstreams**
- delete editor config `app.taskTypes`
- delete metadata plugin projectConfig with type `li-tasks`
- delete Elasticsearch document mapping for li-tasks (see [example](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3625/files))
- configure `tasks-v2`, if you want to continue using tasks, e.g.
  - [Proofreading Task Guide](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/editor/proofreading-task/)
  - [Add a custom task](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/editor/review-task/)

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4196)

### Remove server config search.documentsMetadataFields :fire:

🔥 remove server config `search.documentsMetadataFields`

This config must not be defined anymore, because all metadata are returned when calling the editing API endpoint `/documents`.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4273)

### Remove server event mediaLibraryEntry.added :fire:

🔥 remove server event `mediaLibraryEntry.added`. Use `mediaLibraryEntry.create` instead (same API)

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4270)

### desk-net access removed for read API token :fire:

:fire: removed `desk-net` access for document read API token

If you want to have access to Desk Net with your API token, you need to add the "desk-net integration API access" via API tokens in the editor

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4225)

### Filter unconfigured metadata in publicApi :fire:

Unconfigured metadata are now filtered from the `publicApi`. After a project configuration is updated the metadata properties not configured anymore will be filtered immediately. When saving a document from the editor with an unconfigured property the save will now succeed and unconfigured properties are 'ghosted' in the save operation. The importer will still throw errors for unconfigured metadata properties.

🔥 Filter unconfigured properties from `public Api`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4228)

### Render default UI component per metadata type :fire:

For some metadata plugins, a default UI component is now rendered if `config.hideFromForm` is not set to `true` for a specific metadata property.

add `hideFromForm: true` to the metadata config for any metadata property you want to see **not** rendered and is not in this list:
`li-dependencies`, `li-document-lock`, `li-google-vision`, `li-media-language`, `li-metadata-translations`, `li-moderated-collab`, `li-print`, `li-push-notifications`, `li-routing`, `li-task-v2`.

```js
// contentType config
{
  metadata: [
    {
      handle: 'myText',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        hideFromForm: true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5041)


### Use Vue based form rendering by default :fire:

🔥 editor config `app.metadata.useVueBasedFormRendering` has no effect anymore (remove the config)

Any downstream AngularJS based custom UI component should work as expected. If you have any problems, please do this:
- Tell your contact at Livingdocs about the problem you see. We will make sure to fix the issue.
- Set editor config `app.metadata.useAngularBasedFormRendering: true` in your editor config to temporarily switch back to the Angular based form rendering. This will be possible for `release-2022-03` only and removed in `release-2022-05`.

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5016)

### Remove group property in mainNavigation config :fire:

:fire: Remove support for the `group` property within an `editorSettings.mainNavigation` item.

#### Required Actions

**Old configuration**

The old configuration relied on a `group` property of a `mainNavigation` menu item object to set the group. The possible groups were `top`, `dashboards`, `custom`, `preferences`, and `admin`. The menu items defined using `liItem` would use the group of that item type, and any other custom menu items would be assigned to the `dashboards` group if a group was not specified.

```js
editorSettings: {
  // ...
  mainNavigation: [
    {liItem: 'articles'}, // defaults to dashboard group
    {liItem: 'pages'}, // defaults to dashboard group
    {liItem: 'mediaLibrary'}, // defaults to dashboard group
    {
      label: 'Authors',
      dashboard: 'authors-dashboard',
      icon: 'account'
      // group not specified so it defaults to dashboard group
    },
    {
      label: 'Proofreading',
      dashboard: 'kanban-proofreading',
      icon: 'clipboard-check',
      group: 'custom' // assigned to custom group
    },
    {
      label: 'Livingdocs Website',
      icon: 'rocket',
      href: 'https://www.livingdocs.io',
      group: 'preferences' // assigned to preferences group
    },
    {liItem: 'contentSetup'}, // defaults to preferences group
    {liItem: 'projectSettings'}, // defaults to preferences group
    {
      liItem: 'serverAdmin',
      group: 'preferences' // assigned to preferences group instead of default admin group
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
```

**New configuration**

The new configuration uses a new `mainNavigationGroups` array which provides more flexibility. You can create your own collapsible groups with a label of your choice, and set the style using the `secondary` property. Menu groups and their items will appear in the order they are defined within the arrays. It's also possible to have top-level menu items by not specifying a label.

To re-create the old configuration above you would define the following:

```js
editorSettings: {
  // ...
  // groups are no longer defined in mainNavigation, so delete the group property
  mainNavigation: [
    {liItem: 'articles'},
    {liItem: 'pages'},
    {liItem: 'mediaLibrary'},
    {
      handle: 'authors', // add new handle property for custom navigation items
      label: 'Authors',
      dashboard: 'authors-dashboard',
      icon: 'account'
    },
    {
      handle: 'proofreading',
      label: 'Proofreading',
      dashboard: 'kanban-proofreading',
      icon: 'clipboard-check'
    },
    {
      handle: 'website',
      label: 'Livingdocs Website',
      href: 'https://www.livingdocs.io',
      icon: 'rocket'
    },
    {liItem: 'contentSetup'},
    {liItem: 'projectSettings'},
    {liItem: 'serverAdmin'}
  ],
  mainNavigationGroups: [
    {
      handle: 'dashboards',
      label: 'Dashboards',
      items: [
        'articles',
        'pages',
        'mediaLibrary',
        'authors'
      ]
    },
    {
      handle: 'custom',
      label: 'Custom',
      items: ['proofreading']
    },
    {
      handle: 'preferences',
      label: 'Preferences',
      secondary: true,
      items: [
        'website',
        'contentSetup',
        'projectSettings',
        'serverAdmin'
      ]
    }
  ],
  // ...
}
```

Instead of trying to replicate the menu exactly as it was, it may make more sense to utilise the new functionality:

```js
editorSettings: {
  // ...
  mainNavigation: [
    // Same as the other new configuration example above
  ],
  mainNavigationGroups: [
    {
      // Rename dashboards to documents
      handle: 'documents',
      label: 'Documents',
      items: [
        'articles',
        'pages',
        'authors'
      ]
    },
    {
      // Move the images, videos and files dashboards into a media group
      handle: 'media',
      label: 'Media Library',
      items: ['mediaLibrary']
    },
    {
      // Give the custom dashboard a more meaningful name
      handle: 'workflow',
      label: 'Workflow',
      items: ['proofreading']
    },
    {
      // Move the website link to a top-level menu item (don't define a label for the group)
      handle: 'website',
      secondary: true,
      items: ['website']
    },
    {
      // Update the label name of the preferences group
      handle: 'preferences',
      label: 'Settings',
      secondary: true,
      items: [
        'contentSetup',
        'projectSettings',
        'serverAdmin'
      ]
    }
  ],
  // ...
}
```


### Button group improvement :fire:

If you have any custom UI in your downstream that makes use of any of the following you want to read this:

No longer existing classes:
- `.ld-btn-group`, `.ld-btn-group__item`, `.ld-btn-group__item-v2`, `.ld-btn-group--right`, `.ld-btn-group--full`, `.ld-btn-group--toggle`, `.ld-btn-group--arrow`, `.ld-btn-group--cardchange`, `.ld-btn-group--selection`, `.ld-btn-group--center`, `.ld-btn-group--extension`

You are highly encouraged to refactor your markup / custom stylesheets to not use these things anymore. In order to ease that process, there is a file you can `@import` in your custom SCSS to get support for the mentioned classes and variables:
In the SCSS file you have configured as `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE` or `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER` add this line at the top:
```sass
@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2022-02.scss";
```
This will define the removed classes within your SCSS file tree. Your custom UI will most probably look just fine. From there on you can refactor your code and remove the `@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2022-02.scss";` after you are done. We will keep this file around for some time, but it will eventually get removed. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to contact us.

**Required Actions for Refactoring**
In case you're making use of the above mentioned classes in your downstream:
- Replace any .li-btn-group or .li-button-group element with the new `<li-button-group>` Vue or Angular components
- Buttons should be placed directly within the component
- See the **style guide screenshot below** for examples

## Deprecations

### Postgres

Postgres 11 is now deprecated. Please update to Postgres 14.1 whenever possible.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch 6.x is now deprecated. Please update to Elasticsearch 7 or OpenSearch.

### Configuration `auth.accessTokenSecret`

The configuration `auth.accessTokenSecret` gets replaced by `auth.accessTokenSigningKeys`.
Old configurations are still valid, but make sure you'll convert your secret to a JSON web key as soon as you use the new configuration property.

```diff
  auth: {
-    accessTokenSecret: "some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing"
      // Generate the JSON web key using
      //   $ livingdocs-server key-generate convert-hs256 'some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing'
+    accessTokenSigningKeys: [{"kty":"oct","k":"c29tZS1zZWNyZXQtZm9yLWhtYWMyNTYtdG9rZW4tc2lnbmluZw","kid":"","alg":"HS256","use":"sig"}]
}
```

Take the existing `auth.accessTokenSecret` value and convert it to a JSON web key.
To ease the conversion, we have the following command that outputs the json
for the `auth.accessTokenSigningKeys` array:

```bash
livingdocs-server key-generate convert-hs256 'some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing'
```

### Config ui.component in metadata plugin config

Configuring `ui.component` with the default component name for a type is now deprecated. Please consult the [documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins) to learn about the default components per type. If you have the default component configured, please remove the `ui.component` configuration.

An example:
```js
// contentType config
{
  metadata: [
    {
      handle: 'title',
      type: 'li-text',
      ui: {
        component: 'liMetaTextForm'
      }
    }
  ]
}

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes üî•

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
# migration 194-actors.js
#   add new table actors
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### `includeApi.registerService()` and `includeApi.registerServices()` are now synchronous methods :fire:

`includesApi.registerService()` and `includesApi.registerServices()` behaviour has changed and are now synchronous methods.
If you rely on its return value to be a Promise (e.g. when accessing `.then`), you have to update your code.

* [Server PR: Add new downstream extension API methods](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6169)

### `li-reference` and `li-reference-list` metadata plugins support has been removed :fire:

Please replace `li-reference` with `li-document-reference` and `li-reference-list` with `li-document-references`.
No data migration is required, but you will need to remove `referenceType` from the metadata plugin config.
If you were using `ui.config.searchOnlyPublished` on `li-reference` definitions, you should migrate to `config.published`.

* [Server PR: Remove legacy li-reference and li-reference-list metadata plugins](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6186)
* [Editor PR: Remove legacy li-reference and li-reference-list metadata plugins](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7569)


### Remove old getter functions on DocumentVersion class :fire:

Remove getter functions which have a replacement on the `DocumentVersion` class:
- Remove `documentVersion.getContentType()`, please use `documentVersion.contentType`
- Remove `documentVersion.getDocumentType()`, please use `documentVersion.documentType`
- Remove `documentVersion.getProjectId()`, please use `documentVersion.projectId`
- Remove `documentVersion.getChannelId()`, please use `documentVersion.channelId`
- Remove `documentVersion.getDocumentId()`, please use `documentVersion.documentId`
- Remove `documentVersion.getDesignDescriptor()`, please use `documentVersion.design`
- Remove `documentVersion.getDesignVersion()`, please use `documentVersion.design.version`
- Remove `documentVersion.getTitle()`, please use `documentVersion.title`
- Remove `documentVersion.getMetadata()`, please use `documentVersion.metadata`
- Remove `documentVersion.getMetadataSource()`, please use `documentVersion.metadataSource`
- Remove `documentVersion.getSystemdata()`, please use `documentVersion.systemdata`

* [Server PR: Clean up DocumentVersion class](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6153)

### Remove support for metadata based scheduling supported via editor's configuration `document.customPublicationDateField`

Editor configuration parameter `document.customPublicationDateField` support has been removed. With this change metadata based scheduling is no longer supported.
Please migrate to `contentType.publishControl.publishSchedule` within [Publish Control feature](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/editor/publish-control/publish-control-migration/).

* [Editor PR: Remove support for configuration `document.customPublicationDateField`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7622)

### Remove `metadata['li-language'].label` property support :fire:

`metadata['li-language'].label` won't be used in the editor anymore given native translations make the functionality redundant.

* [Editor PR: Remove li-language's label property from the UI](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7619)

## Deprecations

### Postgres v12 :warning:

Postgres v12 support is deprecated and will be removed in January 2024 release (`release-2024-01`).

### Document Patch API :warning:

Document patch API `document.patch` has been deprecated, and will be removed in `release-2024-01`. Please replace it with `documentApi.executeDocumentCommands`. No data migration is required, but you will need to swap `patches` parameter with `commands`, and `user` with `userId`.

### Endpoint `PATCH /document/:id` :warning: 

Endpoint `PATCH /document/:id` has been deprecated, and will be removed in `release-2024-01`. Please replace it with `PATCH /document/:id/commands`. No data migration is required, but you will need to swap `patches` parameter with `commands`.

### `serverConfig.documents.realtimeUpdates.enabled` :warning:

Please remove the 'enabled' property and use 'pollingEnabled' and/or 'websocketsEnabled' instead. The value for 'enabled' will be transferred to 'pollingEnabled', if 'pollingEnabled' does not have a value defined.

This deprecation is related to the [Teaser includes reload](#teaser-includes-reload) feature. Please read the feature documentation for more information.

## Features

### Command API :gift:

The Command API is exposed on the Public API and allows external services to change document content and metadata and even publish, e.g. making article title A/B-test easier.

Command API adds `PATCH /api/v1/documents/:documentId/commands` endpoint on the Public API, which accepts the following commands to be executed on the document: `setMetadataProperty`, `setEditableDirective` and `publish`. The scope scope to authenticate requests for this new endpoint is `public-api:write`.

More information about the Command API can be found in the [Command API documentation]({{< ref "reference/public-api/command-api.md" >}}).

An example of a `setMetadataProperty` command would look like this:
```
ACCESS_TOKEN=ey1234
curl -k -X PATCH "https://server.livingdocs.io/api/v1/documents/:id/commands" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --data-binary @- << EOF
  {
    "commands": [{"operation": "setMetadataProperty", "propertyName": "title", "value": "updated title"}]
  }
EOF
```

With the introduction of the Command API, we needed a way to differenciate if a document was modified by a user (human) or a token (machine), therefore the 'actor' concept has been introduced. When a document is updated by a token via the Command API, the document will show the specific token that authorized the request.

Please run the migrations for this release to add the new `actors` table to your database. This migration will add Import users and API clients to `actors` table. The actor name will be used to show the actor that modified a document. When reporting modifications on a document users will be obscured and the UI will only report that a human did a modification, while API clients will be reported with their name.

### Search: Use AND operators instead of OR :gift: 

This release we have improved query syntax to allow users to use special operator to improve text based search results. The new search query syntax supports the following operators:
- `+` signifies AND operator
- `|` signifies OR operator
- `-` negates a single token
- `"` wraps a number of tokens to signify a phrase for searching

For example, the query `quick brown +fox -news` will search for documents containing `quick` and `brown` and `fox` and documents that do *not* contain `news`, i.e. `quick` AND `brown` AND `fox` AND NOT `news`. Previously the default operator was `OR`, which meant that the query `quick brown fox` was interpreted as `quick` OR `brown` OR `fox`, i.e. documents would match if they contained any of the three tokens.

You can also use `"` to search for phrases, for example `quick "brown fox"` will only match documents that contain the exact phrase `brown fox` and `quick`, e.g. `The quick fox is brown` wouldn't result in a match, but `The brown fox is quick` would.

Using `|` (OR) operator will result in a match if any of the tokens are present in the document, e.g. `quick | brown | fox` will match documents that contain `quick` OR `brown` OR `fox`, not necessarily all three. Which was the behaviour of search queries in previous releases.

This behaviour is enabled in the Media Library search, and it can be enabled per dashboard for documents search with the following dashboard configuration:

```
{
  search: {
    strategy: "new"
  }
}
```

### Push Notifications

The new Push Notification feature can trigger pushes from within the Article Editor Toolbar, in previous releases it could only trigger pushes on Dashboards.

Support to show the "Push" button for the new "Push Messages". Clicking the button will open the Push messages Dialog.

The "Push" button only shows if a `li-push-messages` metadata plugin is configured. For now, the button will take the first `li-push-messages` metadata plugin config it finds.

### Teaser includes reload

If a document embeds teasers using includes, those teasers will get updated if referenced documents are updated.

### Metadata validation

Introduction of metadata plugin validation in documents, media library and paramSchema. This will prevent unsupported usage of metadata plugin configurations on server side. [Breaking change `Custom downstream plugins param schema validation changes`](#custom-downstream-plugins-param-schema-validation-changes-fire) is related to this feature so please read it carefully.

Plugins used in other contexts than the ones stated in the [docs](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/), will now report an error during server startup.

### Allow `tel:` and `mailto:` inline links

We have added support for `tel:` and `mailto:` URL links in the editor. This feature is enabled by default and doesn't require any configuration.

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `main` branch) is at your own risk

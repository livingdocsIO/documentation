## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Deprecations

## Features



## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:

- TBD

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

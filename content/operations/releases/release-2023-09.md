## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## System Requirements

### Suggested

TODO

### Minimal

TODO

## Features

TODO (featureset not 100% defined yet)


### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

TODO: check migration

## Deprecations

### Metadata Plugins li-reference and li-reference-list

Please replace `li-reference` with `li-document-reference`, and `li-reference-list` with `li-document-references`. No data migration is required, but you will need to remove the `referenceType` property from the metadata plugin config if it is defined. If you encounter any other schema errors please see the documentation for the [`li-document-reference`]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-document-reference" >}}) and [`li-document-references`]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-document-references" >}}) plugins for further details.

## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

### Migrate the Postgres Database ðŸ”¥ 

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop support for AngularJS metadata plugins ðŸ”¥

Custom AngularJS metadata plugins are no longer supported. You should migrate to core metadata plugins, full list [here](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/). If you cannot replace AngularJS plugins with core plugins: contact your Livingdocs customer manager before you write new plugins in Vue.

This includes Angular Metadata UI components, Metadata Services, mixing custom UI with Livingdocs core metadata types and custom types with Livingdocs UI components.

* [Remove Angular Metadata Support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7043) 

### Drop support for Legacy Dashboards ðŸ”¥

Support for Legacy Dashboards has been removed in favor of the new Table Dashboards. If you are using a legacy dashboard, you should migrate to the new Table Dashboard. See [here](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/project-config/editor-settings/#example-table-dashboard/) for more information.

* [Remove Legacy Dashboards & `app.filters.*` support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7283)

### Drop support for `app.filters.pageList`, `app.filters.articleList`, `app.filters.inlineArticleList` and `app.filters.dataRecordList` ðŸ”¥

Support for `app.filters.pageList`, `app.filters.articleList`, `app.filters.inlineArticleList` and `app.filters.dataRecordList` configurations has been removed. Please use specific Table Dashboards instead. See [here](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/project-config/editor-settings/#example-table-dashboard) for more information.

* [Remove Legacy Dashboards & `app.filters.*` support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7283)

### Drop support for `app.filters.documentListList` ðŸ”¥

Configuration `app.filters.documentListList` has no effect anymore.

* [Remove Legacy Dashboards & `app.filters.*` support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7283)

### Drop support for `app.documents.useLegacyDashboards` ðŸ”¥

Configuring `app.documents.useLegacyDashboards` has no effect anymore.
Support for Legacy Dashboards has been dropped. Livingdocs will automatically generate a Table Dashboard with default display filters if no dashboard is explicitly defined.

* [Remove Legacy Dashboards & `app.filters.*` support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7283)

### Drop support for `legacyFilters` in `searchManager.searchPublications()` ðŸ”¥

Customers calling `searchManager.searchPublications()` directly,
and providing a `legacyFilters` property in the first argument, should update to the new `filters` DSL. New Search DSL changes described here:
https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/public-api/publications/search/

* [Remove support for `legacyFilters` property in `searchManager.searchPublications()](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6002)

### Drop support for `project.contentType.publicationIndex.scheduledPublishing` ðŸ”¥

Please remove the `project.contentType.publicationIndex.scheduledPublishing` property from your project config and configure scheduled publishing using Publish Control as described [here](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/editor/publish-control/scheduled-publishing/).

* [Remove support for `project.contentType.publicationIndex.scheduledPublishing`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6003)

### Drop support for `propertyConfig.config.behaveAsLiImage` ðŸ”¥

Custom metadata plugins cannot use `propertyConfig.config.behaveAsLiImage` to take advantage of upstream `li-image` plugin features. Please use type `li-image` instead.

* [Replace `teaserImage` type with `li-image` due `behaveAsLiImage` removal](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6053)

### Structure changes in documents within `li-document-references` ðŸ”¥

We have refactored the structure of documents within `li-document-references` property. We have separated the references array into separate elements for each reference.
Before:
```js
references: [{
  type: 'documents',
  ids: ['1', '2'],
  location: 'metadata',
  propertyName: 'referenceListTest'
}]
```

Now:
```js
references: [{
  type: 'document',
  id: '1',
  location: 'metadata',
  propertyName: 'referenceListTest'
},
{
  type: 'document',
  id: '2',
  location: 'metadata',
  propertyName: 'referenceListTest'
}]
```

* [Cross Project Content Sharing](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6035)

The `storageFormat.label` property within the `li-language` metadata plugin is deprecated and will be removed in `release-2024-01`.

## Features

### Ticker Tool

Livingdocs now offers a tool to create ticker articles with ease. This feature uses a contentType as Ticker Host document, and another contentType as the Ticker Entry. The Ticker Host is used to create a new ticker article, and the Ticker Entry is used to create new entries in the ticker. The Ticker Host can be configured to allow only specific Ticker Entries, and the Ticker Entry can be configured to allow only specific Ticker Hosts.

An example Ticker Host contentType configuration:
```
handle: 'tickerHost',
documentType: 'article',
info: {
  label: 'Ticker'
},

ticker: {
  // The tickerEntry contentType
  entryContentType: 'tickerEntry'
},

publishControl: {
  publishSchedule: true,
  unpublishSchedule: true,
  embargo: true,
  visiblePublicationDateOverride: true,
  visiblePublicationDatePreference: [
    'publishControl.visiblePublicationDateOverride',
    'metadata.publicationDate',
    'publishControl.firstPublicationDate'
  ],
  significantPublicationDate: true
},

components: [
  {name: 'web-teaser'},
  {name: 'title'},
  {name: 'p'},
  {name: 'button'},
  {name: 'section-title'},
  {name: 'image'},
  {name: 'image-named-crops'},
  {name: 'video'},
  {name: 'video-include'},
  {name: 'teaser-include'},
  {name: 'teaser-include-small'},
  {name: 'teaser-include-translated'},
  {name: 'teaser-list-include'},
  {name: 'teaser-list-include-params-schema'},
  {name: 'insta'},
  {name: 'echo'},
  {name: 'youtube'},
  {name: 'twitch'},
  {name: 'social'},
  {name: 'oembed-include'},
  {name: 'free-html'},
  {name: 'container'}
],

metadata: [
  {
    handle: 'title',
    type: 'li-text',
    ui: {
      label: {
        en: 'Title',
        de: 'Titel'
      }
    }
  }
],

editorWrapper: '<section class="container doc-section"></section>',
defaultContent: [
  {component: 'title'}
]
```
An example Ticker Entry contentType configuration:
```
handle: 'tickerEntry',
documentType: 'article',
info: {
  label: 'Ticker Entry'
},

// Content
editorWrapper: '<section class="container doc-section" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"></section>',
defaultContent: [
  {
    component: 'title'
  }
],

components: [
  {name: 'title'},
  {name: 'p'}
],

// Metadata
metadata: [
  {
    handle: 'tickerHost',
    type: 'li-document-reference',
    config: {
      contentType: 'tickerHost'
    }
  }
]
```
Notice the Ticker Host contentType has a `ticker` property, which defines the Ticker Entry contentType. The Ticker Entry contentType has a `metadata` property, which defines the Ticker Host contentType. This is how the Ticker Host and Ticker Entry are linked together.

For more information and limitations of the Ticker Tool, see [here]().

### Anchor Linking

When selecting a document in the inline link edit tool or in `li-tree`, it is now possible to also select a specific component within that document. The directiveId (= componentId:directiveName) will then be included in the URL hash part.

To enable anchor linking for a project, at least one component with a doc-editable and `anchor: true` must be defined within the project config. For example:

```
  name: 'title',
  label: 'Title',
  directives: [{
    type: 'editable',
    name: 'title',
    anchor: true
  }],
  html: dedent`
    <h2 doc-editable="title">
      Title
    </h2>
  `
```

### Display and Base Filters

In the July 2023 release, we introduced in the possibility for users to create configurable filters. This release we extend the filter functionality to more core metadata plugins.

We have added the possibility to configure display filters for the following metadata plugins:
- `li-string-list` with `dataProvider`
- `li-enum` with `dataProvider`
- `li-text` with `dataProvider`
- `li-document-reference` with `style: minimal`
- `li-document-references` with `style: minimal`

We have added the possibility to configure base filters for the following metadata plugins:
- `li-desknet-integration`
- `li-retresco`
- `li-imatrics-nlp-tags`

For this filters to take effect you must index the metadata properties in Elasticsearch/Opensearch. To do so you have to define `index: true` in the metadata plugin config. See [here](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/#indexing) for more information.

### Multilanguage includes in French and Italian

Livingdocs UI has been translated to more languages. We now support French and Italian on top of English and German. A new language switcher has been added to the user profile for a personalized experience. By default, the language defined in the editor configuration `app.locale` is used.

Administrators can define which languages are available in the language dropdown by configuring `app.availableLocales` in the editor configuration. Supported languages are `en`, `de`, `fr` and `it`. The language switch stays hidden if `app.availableLocales` is `undefined` or `[]`.

```js
app: {
  locale: 'en',
  availableLocales: ['en', 'de', 'fr', 'it']
}
```

### Publish Control UX improvements

We have improved Publish Control UI to make it easier to use. No configuration changes are required from developers perspective to take advange of the improvements. The main improvements are:
- The visual feedback for Metadata errors blocking a publish is improved
- Unpublish Buttons use red text color now to be more clear about the potentially damaging effects
- The confirm step presented when a publish is scheduled and the user clicks "Publish Now" has more visual clarity now

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-36665](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h755-8qp9-cq85) patched in `protobufjs` v7.2.4
* [CVE-2022-25883](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw) patched in `semver` v5.7.2, v6.3.1, v7.5.4
* [CVE-2023-26115](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8xg-fqg3-53r7) patched in `word-wrap` v1.2.4

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2022-26136](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3) patched in `tough-cookie` v4.1.3
* [CVE-2022-25883](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw) patched in `semver` v5.7.2, v6.3.1, v7.5.4

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

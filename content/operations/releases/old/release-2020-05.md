# Highlights

## Editor UI Changes

We did an iteration on the side panel next to the document to integrate
the comments more seamlessly into the editing experience as well as prepare
the editor for future mobile optimisations.

### Canvas added
We have now removed the side-panel for properties and comments. Instead we have a canvas on the right side of the document that is visible by default. That way users do not have to jump between editing and comment modes and comments are more visible if there are any.
As a general improvement the scrollbar of the document is now on the right side of the canvas which feels more natural.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4352425/80966827-8f6d8c00-8e15-11ea-8335-d1c042d2611a.png)

### Comments moved to Canvas
The comments are now shown in the canvas. And instead of using tabs to switch between open and resolved comments which comments are visible can be controlled from the collaboration-bar. The default is that the open comments will be shown and the resolved comments will be hidden.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4352425/80967132-26d2df00-8e16-11ea-89f4-66e29a21460c.png)

### properties-panel
The properties-panel is not a side-panel anymore. Now it is a panel over the canvas and can be minimised.

## Translations :tada:

Livingdocs now supports translations. You can for example create an article in german and translate this document into another language like english.

![Translations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39759830/80695632-79d72a00-8ad6-11ea-90e2-3e5107336d5c.gif)

## Webhooks :tada:

Livingdocs adds Webhooks to the core system. Webhooks can be configured to call a 3rd-party endpoint on `document.published` and `document.unpublished` event.
Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/294) if you want to know more.

## Custom Document Preview :tada:

Livingdocs now supports a custom document preview. You are now able to register your own rendering function to generate a preview of
your delivery system like your webpage or an RSS feed. It's even thinkable to generate a truly native app preview. For more information on how to do it look into the [Server Pull Request](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2887).

## Delivery Links :tada:

Delivery links are shown in the publish panel when a document is published. These links are usually used to check if the document has been published correctly on the website.
You can now configure more than one of these links through channelConfig (or UI).
Check out the [Editor Pull Request](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3453) if you want to know more.

## 2 Times Faster Image Upload :tada: :speedoat:

If you upload/drop an image into Livingdocs, the image upload is now twice as fast with the new `libvips` strategy.

### Dropped image format support :fire:

- `libvips` does not support `.bmp`images, but supports HEIC (iphone format for images)

```js
// change your environment config on the server to upload images twice as fast as with the 'imagemagick' strategy
images: {
  processingStrategy: 'libvips'
}
```

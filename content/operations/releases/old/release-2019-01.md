# Highlights

## Do not disturb mode :gift:

With a soft lock a user can indicate that she wants the document for herself and not to be disturbed by other editors taking over. Other editors are still able to take over (thus soft lock) but they need to confirm that they want to overwrite the soft lock. A soft lock has a configurable timeout after which it expires. If the user that requested the soft lock leaves the document, the soft lock will be automatically released. Same goes for closing of the browser.

Once the soft lock is enabled for a content-type (e.g. articles) a "Lock" button will be visible in the top toolbar.

To enable the do not disturb mode, add this code snippet to your metadata config:

```js
{
  handle: 'documentSoftLock',
  type: 'li-document-soft-lock',
  config: {
    lockTimeout: 5 // change to your desired timeout in minutes
  }
}
```

## Advanced Component Groups :gift:

In the editor, you can now search for components, expand and collapse groups.

To enable the advanced component groups, you have to add this configuration to the editor.

```js
app: {
    editor: {
      insertPanel: {
        useAdvancedComponentGroups: true
      }
    }
}
```

Introduce a structural view of the document (tree view) in the split panel that allows a user to navigate the document by its component and container structure.

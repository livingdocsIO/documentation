# Highlights

## Media Library :gift:

We introduce a new media library in Livingdocs that allows to track and search all images uploaded to Livingdocs and to manage metadata for those images. As an option we offer auto-tagging of all uploaded images using the Google Vision API (infers costs). We also introduced a new image service `liImageProxy` which allows to track all image requests through the server, e.g. for traffic control.

## Improved Dashboard Search / Implement Your Own Dashboard Search :gift:

### Better Default Search

:tada: The editor dashboard search has been massively improved and now you get much better search results.
We did a lot of improvements to the default search algorithm. The most important change is, that recent edited articles have much more importance, which you can see in the following digram.



- y-axis: importance boost
- x-axis: time of editing an article
- black line: importance boost / time

![47582728-86187f00-d955-11e8-8a79-19d1aca8982c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/172394/57685243-cc0a0b80-7637-11e9-99cf-4e1a9ad3c961.png)

### Custom Search

:gift: You can also implement your own Dashboard search by registering a [queryBuilderPlugin](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2395).

## Predefined Filter Sets :gift:

Enables predefined Filter Sets on a dashboard.
Project admins can navigate to any dashboard, choose filters and then store the setting in a predefined filter set which is similar in kind to a bookmark.
The filter sets can be edited over a user interface in the project setup and can be nested in groups (one-level deep) for organizing.
Users (non-admins) can see and use the predefined filter sets, i.e. on a dashboard, e.g. the article dashboard, they can choose a filter set which will then apply the complete set selection of filters to the dashboard.

## Custom Workflows with Tasks v2 :gift:

With Tasks (v2) you are able to define custom workflows in the editor. It's an overhauled version which replaces Tasks (v1). You can find the migration guide from Tasks v1 to v2 [here](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2606).

Highlights of Tasks v2:
- Tasks have 3 states (`requested`, `accepted`, `completed`)
- Define your custom metadata field for every task
- Every tasks is individually configurable, e.g.
  - labels for all states
  - request a deadline date
  - define when a task appears urgent
- Customise the deadline computation via the core API in the editor
  - Register a function to make suggestion for the deadline date
  - Register a function to provide an allowed deadline date range
- Tasks can be connected with the the Task Kanban Board (which is mentioned in the beta section)

## Google Cloud Storage support for designs/files/images :gift:

For users who want to store their images, files and design assets in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket rather than on Amazon, we provide a separate storage strategy.

Required server configuration to enable storing assets on GCS.
```
storage: {
  strategy: 'google-cloud-storage',
  config: {
    bucket: 'livingdocs-images-dev', // The bucket name
    credentials: {} // The credentials
  }
}
```


A more detailled description and an example configuration can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/server/google-cloud-storage)

## Improve speed of reindexing :gift:

Depending on how many documents you have stored, the re-indexing into Elasticsearch needed some time. For production this has been a challenge for a long time, when you did an upgrade where data migrations were involved or even an Elasticsearch mapping update.

Since the January 2019 release, we have continually improved the indexing speed. The optimisation results in a `10x - 100x` speed improvement and an average indexing speed of `1000 docs/s`. The indexing speed depends on your Elasticsearch configuration and the size of your documents.




# Beta Versions

You can use and test beta features. Your feedback is highly appreciated. As long as a feature is in beta phase, we will sometimes change it's UX, design or config if needed.

## Track Changes (Differ) :tada:

We now have the much anticipated Track Changes feature in the editor. Track Changes shows you changes between two versions of a document e.g.

- added and removed components
- added and removed text

Every change is labeled by the user which did the change. You are also able to configure the color palette of the changes to match your design.

Track Changes is available at the editor in the History menu.

We are actively working on Track Changes and its UI. We are happy to hear feedback and ideas how to improve the feature from you.

## Customisable Dashboards/Kanbanboards :tada:

Custom Dashboards are configurable versions of the current Articles / Pages / Date-Records Screens you can use to customise the main screens your editors and writers
use on a daily basis. Kanbanboards are a variation of dashboards to better support
task based workflows in your teams.

You can add as many custom dashboards as you want in the Editor configuration and
link them directly in the main navigation.

See the [documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/editor/menu-and-dashboards) for details.

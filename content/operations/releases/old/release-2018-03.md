# Highlights

## Multi Language Support :gift: :fire:

This release introduce multi language support in the Livingdocs core. A more detailed description about the setup and the feature can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/walkthroughs/setup_multilanguage.html).

The activation of the feature requires a re-index of Elasticsearch (including the new mapping): `grunt search-index:document:reset`

[server PR #1881](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1881) / [editor PR #1929](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1929)

## Configurable search filter for empty queries on the dashboard :gift: :fire:

This change brings a new option named `emptySearchQueries` for `filters` (e.g. `articleList`). `emptySearchQueries` specifies the filter & sorting rules when the search field is empty.


### Required Actions

To get the previous search behaviour back of the last version, you have to provide `-updated_at` in the editor `emptySearchQueries` option (compare `defaultQueries` and `emptySearchQueries`):
```
filters: {
  articleList: {
    displayFilters: ['channels', 'contentType', 'timeRange'],
    defaultQueries: [
      {type: 'documentType', value: 'article'},
      {type: 'sortBy', value: 'relevance'}
    ],
    emptySearchQueries: [
      {type: 'documentType', value: 'article'},
      {type: 'sortBy', value: '-updated_at'}
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells the editor to provide `sortBy` -> `-updated_at` in case there is no search query input available.


For a more detailed description have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/editor-configuration/search-filters.html), the [server PR #1885](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1885) and the [editor PR #1939](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1939)


## Project toggle support (alpha) :gift: :fire:

A user can now switch between 2 or more projects in the Editor. This feature is in alpha state and can only be activated with manually assigning a user to another project via the database.

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Server
* Editor API
  * The `GET /projects/:id` endpoint now uses properties that are in **camelCase**.
   That shouldn't have any affect in the editor as we transform everything anyways.
  * `GET /projects` now returns the projects of a specific user.
    An admin can't call that endpoint to retrieve all the projects anymore.
* Public API
  * no breaking changes
* Core API
  * `project.default_channel_id` has been renamed to `project.defaultChannelId`
  * `project.config.import_user` has been renamed to `project.importUserId`

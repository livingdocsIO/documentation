# Highlights

## Editor Multiselect :gift:

Add multiselect functionality to the editor. In multiselect mode when a component is clicked this component is added to the selection. When a component is clicked again it is removed from the selection. In the sidebar the count of selected components is shown and there is the option to delete all selected components.

Required editor configuration to enable the multiselect feature:

```js
keyboardShortcuts: {
      '↓shift': 'start multiselect mode',
      '↑shift': 'end multiselect mode'
}
```

## Show Icon and Description in Component :gift:

Our component list in the sidebar looked too boring. This change enables designers to add icons and descriptions that are shown in the 'insert components' sidebar.

Example:
```html
<script type="ld-conf">
{
  "name": "p"
  "label": "Paragraph",
  "iconUrl": "https://livingdocs.io/images/building_blocks_magazine.svg",
  "description": "Your main writing tool"
}
</script>

<p doc-editable="text">
  foo
</p>
```


# Breaking Changes :fire:

##  Registration procedure :gift: :fire:

There are two new flags per authentication connections: `loginEnabled` and `registrationEnabled`. The editor won't show the respective connection option
in the login screen without them.

Server `auth` configuration:
```js
auth: {
  connections: {
    // email and password authentication
    local: {
      enabled: true,
      loginEnabled: true,
      registrationEnabled: true
      //...
    },
    github: {
      enabled: true,
      loginEnabled: false,
      registrationEnabled: false
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

##  Save metadata config :gift: :fire:

Removed property `channel.availableVersions` in the editor.
This property is not available anymore. It is not used anywhere we know of. Please contact us if you have been using this.

# Highlights

## Manual migration script to fix content types :beetle:

In the current releases (january & february) the content_type column on the publication events table is missing all the data. The script ./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/004-write-content-type-on-events-table.js inserts that data in a non-blocking script.

We won't do a blocking migration as that might cause downtime for big customers (we'll need to find good solutions for that in the future). Please run the regular migration and after that apply the manual one. A blocking migration that makes sure that all columns are `NOT NULLABLE` will follow in the february or march release.

### Required Action
```bash
./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/003-write-content-type-v2.js
# and
./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/004-write-content-type-on-events-table.js
```

## Routing :gift:

The routing now supports contentType specific routing configuration. The
configuration also offers more options and possibilities.

Example contentType configuration:
```js
routing: {
  enabled: true,
  pathPatterns: {
    // type 'article' needs to have an `:id` in the path pattern
    type: 'article',
    // path pattern used to build and parse paths
    current: '/:YYYY/:MM/:DD/:slug--:id',
    // previously used path patterns, used to parse paths if current failed
    legacy: [
      '/article/:slug--:id'
    ]
  }
}
```

For details see: [Server PR #1673](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1673)

For documentation see: [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/r-public-api/routing-system.html)


## Support for Animated gifs in the Images Editing API :gift:

The editor now supports animated gifs.

[Server PR #1858](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1858)


## Reduce image flashing when uploading an image :beetle:

[Editor PR #1829](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1829)


## Scroll to inlined errors :gift:

When publishing a document and having a validation error, the browser now scrolls automatically to the erroneous metadata field.

[Editor PR #1874](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1874)



## Throw an Error if there are no configured Metadata Plugins :beetle:

- Fix: Improve the warning log when the contentType can not be loaded.
- Fix: Throw an error on workspace creation (open article), when no metadata plugins are configured

### Deprecations

- `channel.getContentTypeConfig` is deprecated and has been replaced with `channel.getContentType`.

[Editor PR #1918](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1918)


## Add contentType selection to page creation :beetle:

The page creation now includes choosing a content type before setting the page title.

### Deprecations

- ui-router state `app.editor.articles` moved to `app.articles`
- method `documentCreator.createArticle()` changed to the more generic `documentCreator.createDocument()`. The createDocument method also optionally accepts title and metadata parameters. This gives you more flexibility when creating articles.

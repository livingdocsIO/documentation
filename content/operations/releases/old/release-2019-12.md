# Highlights


## Real Time Collaboration :tada:
The users can now work on the same document at the same time. The editor will update automatically to the newest version and shows where the other users are editing.

- Content and metadata are synchronized with other users
   - When a new version of a document is saved to the server through another user the document in the editor is updated without blocking.
   - When a user is editing on a component the other user will see on which component a user is working and can't edit this component during that time
![concurrentEditing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4352425/69640367-80accd00-105e-11ea-8a50-6aa9215cb304.PNG)

   - When metadata are changed through another user this changes will also be automatically synchronized
   - when a comment is created it will be also synchronized
   - when a user is on the publish screen and another is updating the content it will show a message on the publish screen that the content is updated
![publishscreen_updatecontent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4352425/69640047-f95f5980-105d-11ea-9011-52bb6256f73f.PNG)

- conflict handling
   - if the content is updated with the server version and there were changes on the same component the conflict mode is opened and a user can solve the conflicts
![conflictMode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4352425/69640072-067c4880-105e-11ea-80d8-782f89807fda.PNG)

   - if the same metadata property is changed the version from the server will be taken and a message is shown that the local version is overwritten.
- all users which are on the document are shown
   - it shows which users are viewing the document
   - it shows which users are editing
   - the same information is also shown on the publish screen
- In the history the moves of a component will be also marked

## Server and Project Administrator Improvements :tada:

For the December release we worked on several improvements for Admins. Here is a summary of the changes:

* A server admin can reactivate an archived user [#2977](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2977) :gift:.
* A server admin can create a user with an optional lifespan [#2967](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2967) :gift:.
* A project admin can initiate a design migration (design bump) [#2811](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2811) :gift:.
* A project admin can invite a user which already existed in another project [#2641](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2641) :beetle:. The invitation was only possible for new users and is now fixed.

## Desk-Net Integration :tada:

We previously released a [MVP](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-release-notes/blob/master/releases/release-2019-07.md#desk-net-integration-tada) for the Desk-Net integration. With the December release we went from MVP to fully supported feature.

The additions:
* Feature can be fully configured in a UI for the channel-config
* The publication sync can be configured (turned on and off)
* Desk-Net types can be mapped to Livingdocs content-types to control which content-type should be created
* Simple Desk-Net metadata values can be mapped from Desk-Net to Livingdocs
* More complicated values or even content can be mapped from Desk-net to Livingdocs via our code API: https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/server/desknet-integration#advanced-mappings-using-transform-functions
* We added full documentation for the feature: [Desk-Net Integration - Livingdocs](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/server/desknet-integration)

# Breaking Changes :fire:

## Migrate the database :fire:

The database migration is expected to be fast, easy and without issues.
The fields `channels.disabled_versions` and `channels.available_versions` are deleted, but were not used in the last release.

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database schema
# migration - 125-add-group-member-list-table.js
#   fix the migration script for the group_project_members table
# migration - 126-migrate-scope-column-to-text.js
#   migrating the scope column on the group_projection_v3 table from a varchar(255) to a text type
# migration - 127-remove-channel-disabled-design-version.js
#   remove not used 'channel.disabled_versions' and 'channel.available_versions'
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

## Drop Support for Node 8 :fire:

All our services and customers are already using node 10, but in case you're on an old version, make sure that you're either using our base images `livingdocs/server-base:12.0` for node 12 or `livingdocs/server-base:10.0` for node 10.

  * [livingdocs-server #2538](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2538)


## Drop Support for Elasticsearch <6.x :fire:

Drop support for Elasticsearch `< v6.x`. Please upgrade your metadata mapping and configure the server config `search.apiVersion` to `6.x`.
As reference, we've introduced Elasticsearch 6 in [#2017](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2017).

## Removed Functions and Properties from the channelApi :fire:

We removed all functions related to the available versions and disabled versions
that were previously stored on channel records. These function were not used as far
as we know and had an inconsistent API.

The following functions are removed from the channelApi:
- :fire: channelApi.removeDesignVersion()
- :fire: channelApi.addDesignVersion()
- :fire: channelApi.enableDesignVersion()
- :fire: channelApi.disableDesignVersion()
- :fire: channelApi.isDesignEnabled()
- :fire: channelApi.isDesignVersionDisabled()
- :fire: channelApi.isDesignVersionAvailable()

The following functions are removed from the channel_model:
- :wrench: channelModel.isCurrentDesignVersion()

## Editor: Introduce Draft and DraftStorage to Workspace :fire:

The workspace internals got a big refactoring so we can support realtime-collaboration.

If you have custom code in you livingdocs-editor search your project for the following accessors:

- `workspace.document`: replaced by the new `workspace.draft`. The draft offers most properties that were available on the document (but mind that `workspace.document.id` is now `workspace.draft.documentId`). The loaded document now is readOnly and is internally stored in `draft.remoteDocument`. Also any changes through `draft.livingdoc`, `draft.metadata` and `draft.changeTitle()` are monitored and it should not be necessary to call `autosave.informOfChanges()` anymore.
- `workspace.metadata`: use `workspace.draft.metadata` instead
- `workspace.autosave`: now lives in `workspace.draftStorage.autosave`. But it is better to not access autosave directly but use `draftStorage` directly.

## Show correct components in the editor for legacy group definitions in the design :fire:

🔥If you still define component groups within `layouts` in your design then `groups` defined on the top level of the design json will be ignored now.

But we recommend to upgrade your design config and define the allowed components, the default content and the wrapper directly on the contentType and define the component groups once in the design without using the `layouts` config at all.

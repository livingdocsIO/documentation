# Highlights

## Search API for Publications :tada:

The new publication search API allows customers to search and filter in the set of published documents. You can run your frontend search from it and use it to fetch documents for automated lists such as category lists or feed provider (SDA, DPA) lists. You can also configure custom sort dates as well as scheduled publishing, i.e. embargo dates for your content.

  * [Public API - Search Publications]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/publications/search" >}})
  * [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/server/publication-index)
  * [server PR #2695](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2695)

## Real Time Activity Log on Publish Screen :tada:

The sidebar of the publish screen now receives realtime updates of the document (work status of other users).

![someone-else-editing-while-in-publish](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39759830/72153230-9a576900-33ad-11ea-99e2-6fc772c37288.gif)

References:
  * [editor PR #3174](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3174)


## Login into a Specific Project :tada:

There are 2 new improvements:
- After a login the editor routes the user to the last opened project.
- It's now possible to login into a specific project with `<your-editor-url>/login/:projectHandle`

  * [editor PR #3085](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3085)


# Breaking Changes :fire:

## Migrate the database

The migration is simple, the duration is short and there are no datalosses expected on up-/downgrade.

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database scheme
# migration - 128-add-user-agent-access-tokens.js
#   add field access_tokens.user_agent
# migration - 129-add-index-user-id-created-at-access-tokens.js
#   add index to access_tokens.user_id | access_tokens.created_at
# migration - 130-groups-stream-migration.js
#   add stream_types and stream_event_types for groups

livingdocs-server migrate up
```

## Minimum node and npm version updated :fire:

Due to security reasons, we are bumping node and npm minimum requirements

- minimum node requirement: >= `node@10.13.0`
- minimum NPM requirement: >= `npm@6.13.4`

References:
  * [livingdocs-editor #3134](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3134)


## Context Object for include API :fire:

To have more infos during the rendering of `doc-includes`, we pass now a context object into the rendering functions of the `includesApi`.

New Required param context on includes API methods
- :fire: includesApi.processHtml({html, context}) - context is now mandatory
- :fire: includesApi.resolveChannelOutputs({renderConfig, channelOutputs, context}) context is now mandatory
- :fire: includesApi.resolveInclude(serviceName, serviceParams, options) - options.context is now mandatory
- :fire: Editing API: POST /includes/preview requires the context param (old Editor versions won't be able to resolve includes).

References:
  * [server PR #2783](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2783) :gift:

## embeds config `allowUnrecognizedEmbeds` is working again :fire:
The config
```json
embeds: {
  options: {
    allowUnrecognizedEmbeds: true
  }
}
```
must be set to true if a free-html component is used and no [custom embedHandler](https://docs.livingdocs.io/general-howtos/instagram_embed#adding-an-embed-class) is registered. Otherwise the free-html component doesn't work anymore and the input is not saved.

# APIs :gift:

## Public API - fetch a design - `api/v1/design/:designVersion`

It's now possible to fetch a design configuration via Public API.

References:
  * [Public API]({{< ref "/reference/public-api" >}})
  * [server PR #2617](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2617)

## CoreAPI - Improve API for Dashboard Filters :tada:

We introduced a Dashboard List Filter named `List Filter v2`.

This filter has 2 advantages over `List Filter`:
- Fetch the data asynchronous (instead of synchronous)
- Be able to compose the filter with injected data like `project`, `user`, `server`

References:
  * [Dashboard List Filter (deprecated)](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/editor/menu-and-dashboards#register-custom-list-filter)
  * [Dashboard List Filter v2](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-documentation/editor/menu-and-dashboards#register-custom-list-v2-filter)

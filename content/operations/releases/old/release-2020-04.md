## Comyan Integration :tada:

Comyan is beside Hugo the second Asset Management System we have integrated into Livingdocs.

To use the feature, activate Comyan in the environment config on the server (see example). As a next step you
can configure the Comyan integration in the project setup of the editor under the menu item "Intergrations - Comyan".

```js
integrations: {
  comyan: {
    allowed: true
  }
}
```

# Breaking Changes :fire:

## Migrate the database

The migration is simple, the duration is short and there are no datalosses expected on up-/downgrade.

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database schema
# migration - 131-add-fields-to-assets.js
#   add 2 fields to assets table
# migration - 132-add-asset-import-errors.js
#   add 2 tables for asset import
# migration - 133-remove-ref-from-assets.js
#   remove assets.ref field
# migration - 134-change-asset-import-jobs.js
#   rename table introduced in 132-add-asset-import-errors.js

livingdocs-server migrate up
```

## Color Normalization

Some variable names have changed and some existing variables have been matched with slightly new colors. This may result in problems with some downstreams.

### Migration advice for downstreams :fire:

```
The following color variables need to be migrated:
- $ld-c-green-three => $ld-c-green-two
- $ld-c-green-four => $ld-c-green-three
- $ld-c-green-five => $ld-c-green-four
- $ld-c-violet-three => $ld-c-violet-two
- $ld-c-yellow-two => $ld-c-yellow-three
- $ld-c-yellow-one => $ld-c-yellow-two
- $ld-c-yellow-zero => $ld-c-yellow-one
- $ld-white => $ld-c-white
- All colors ending on â€¦-background => â€¦-bg
- All colors ending on â€¦-border => â€¦-bd

For existing semantic color assignments in downstream, please note, that there are new variables available:
- $ld-c-success-one
- $ld-c-success-two
- $ld-c-alert-one
- $ld-c-alert-two
- $ld-c-error-one
- $ld-c-error-two

Removed colors:
- $ld-blue-notify
```

## Image Upload Refactoring

We tried to make the image upload more consistent. For that we had to introduce breaking changes.

### Needed Actions in the Editor :fire:

* :fire: Replace `imageProxy`/`uploadProxy` with `assetProxy`
* :fire: Renamed component `ldNativeImageUpload` to `liImageUploadButton`
* :fire: Changed `liImageUploadButton` implementation (see example)


before:
```js
    // html:
    <button ld-native-image-upload
      class="ld-btn ld-btn--default"
      success-action="$ctrl.onUploadSuccess"
      error-action="$ctrl.onUploadError"
      progress-action="$ctrl.onUploadProgress">Upload Image</button>

    // controller:
    onUploadSuccess (upload) {
      this.isUploading = false
      this.image = {height: upload.height, width: upload.width, url: upload.url, mime: upload.mime}
    }

    onUploadError (error) {
      this.isUploading = false
    }

    onUploadProgress ({progress}) {
      this.uploadProgress = progress
      this.uploadError = null
    }
```

after:
```js
  // html:
    <li-image-upload-button
      class="ld-btn ld-btn--default"
      on-upload="$ctrl.onUpload">Upload image</li-image-upload-button>

  // controller:
  get uploadProgress () { return this.upload && this.upload.progress }
  get isUploading () { return !!this.upload }

  async onUpload (upload) {
    this.upload = upload

    await upload.promise.finally(() => {
        this.upload = undefined
      })

    this.image = {height: upload.height, width: upload.width, url: upload.url, mime: upload.mime}
  }
```

  * [Editor PR #3261](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3261)


## Changed Metadata Service Parameter

The function `getSelectables` in a custom metadata service (e.g. `languageSelection`)  with the form `li-meta-select-form` has changed it's parameter.

### Needed Actions :fire:
```js
// search for downstream metadata plugins with form 'li-meta-select-form'
// check if they have defined a service property
{
  name: 'language',
  form: 'li-meta-select-form',
  config: {
    label: 'Language',
    service: 'languageSelection',
    placeholder: 'select language..'
}

// languageSelection.js
// before
getSelectables(cb)

// changed to
getSelectables(name, cb) // name = metadata property name
```

## Improve Imatrics Integration

The Imatrics configuration is now integrated into the integrations, therefore we moved the configuration too.

### Needed Actions :fire:
- :fire: server channeld-config: moved imatrics config from `settings.imatrics` to `settings.integrations.imatrics`
- :fire: server environment-config: moved `imatrics.enabled` to `integrations.imatrics.allowed`

* References
  * [Server PR #2877](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2877)


## Support Custom CSS Styles

By default the editor now uses a strict set of CSS files which don't support Sass variables anymore.
In case you want to add custom CSS styles, you'll need to declare one of the environment variables based on the desired order.

The styles in `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE` get loaded before the Livingdocs Editor styles,
and the styles in `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER` get loaded after the Livingdocs Editor styles.

As there are separate build processes for the upstream and downstream Sass files now, there is no need anymore to `@include` the upstream editor styles in your custom Sass file.

In case you don't need custom styles, you can remove your `app/styles` folder and don't set the environment variables.

```js
CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE=./app/styles.scss
// or
CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER=./app/styles.scss
```

### Breaking Change :fire:
- :fire: editor: removed support for environment variable `EDITOR_STYLE_PATH`

* References
  * [Editor PR #3337](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3337)


## Asset Proxy Refactoring

This refactoring **should** only have an effect on the upstream. To be on the save side, check the downstream too.

### Needed Actions :fire:
- :fire: search for `assetProxy.postImage(file)` and replace it with `assetProxy.postImage({file, metadata})`
- :fire: search for `assetProxy.addImage(file, image)` and replace it with `assetProxy.addImage({file, metadata})`

* References
  * [Editor PR #3358](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3358)

## Remove old import configs

If you have started with the boilerplate there may be some outdated configs that need to be removed or moved.
In case the importer is not actively used it can be removed together with the configs as there is a public-API version available now.
In case the custom-import (+configs) are used, the configs should be moved accordingly.

### Needed Actions :fire:

The `import: {}` configs for the livingdocs-server are now validated more strictly. Legacy configs should be either removed or moved to a `customImport: {}` config section.

Example:
https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate/commit/8cab034735cdfa3aec8a90e4d98aab32e5d87b74#diff-944c02e3009e6c7ddedd2ee2ddebee4aL150


# APIs :gift:

## Document and Image Import :tada:

Finally, Livingdocs offers a public API endpoint for Import (import of documents/images).

References:
  * [Document Batch Import Documentation (see changelog)](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2842)
  * [Image Batch Import Documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3283)
  * [Image Batch Import Implementation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/2786)
  * [Create write tokens for the public API](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3324)

## Data Sources :tada:

The basic idea behind a dataSource is that you can fetch/transform any dataSource (e.g. a public gist or another URL) and provide the results to any server feature or use it in the editor as a dataSource for metadata or filters.

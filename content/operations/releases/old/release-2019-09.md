- [v41.9.37](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/releases/tag/v41.9.37): fix(hugo-drag-and-drop): Map huGO text fields to image directives

https://tracking.nzzmg.ch/browse/WCMS-4962

This will allow multiple hugoPicture text fields to be imported into dropped images.

The mapping of which `hugoPicture` field is mapped to which `image` component directive is done via a server configuration that looks like this:
```
  hugo: {
    resource: {
      images: {
        directiveMappings: [
          {
            directiveName: 'caption',
            hugoFields: [
              {
                name: 'caption'
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            directiveName: 'author',
            hugoFields: [
              {
                name: 'author',
                options: {
                  shouldRemoveReference: true,
                  isStartCase: true
                }
              },
              {
                name: 'source'
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

If this mapping is not configured a simple `caption` -> `caption` mapping is assumed (as is the previous behavior).

If multiple hugo fields are mapped to a single image directive the texts of all the fields are concatenated (comma-separated).

The mapping config introduces the following formatting options for the imported hugo text:

`isStartCase`: text will be converted to initial caps, e.g.
`JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN` -> `John Ronald Reuel Tolkien`
`frodo baggins` -> `Frodo Baggins`

`shouldRemoveReference`: will remove the substring ` via [some entity]` which is often added to the author name, e.g.
`John Rambo via www.aaargh.com` -> `John Rambo`

# Highlights

## Categories :gift:

The categories feature allows to organise routing information and category related metadata such as ad campaigns, analytics, etc.
We provide a Monaco Editor instance in the Project Setup to edit the categories information as a JSON. In addition there are new metadata plugins to enable the categories on content-types as well as a one-click setup that sets up all metadata for pages and articles in one go.

For use in the frontend projects we provide new public API endpoints:
* :heavy_plus_sign: `/routing/resolve` to resolve a given path to a document id
* :heavy_plus_sign: `/categories` to get all categories
* :heavy_plus_sign: `/categories/:id` to get a specific category
Detailed documentation on the new public API endpoints is in the public API documentation `<your-editor-host>/public-api`.

## Reindex Documents via Operation Screen :gift:

Reindexing will often be used when one wants to have updated metadatadata and design for deliveries.
A server administrator can now reindex documents via the `Operations` panel (Server Administration -> Operations) in the editor.
The reindexing mechanism is the same as via the `livingdocs-server` CLI.

## Teaser Preview :gift:

The Teaser Preview adds an additional read-only view to the publication section of the Livingdocs Editor. It is by default disabled and can only be enabled and configured in a content type config. Examples and more details how to set up a teaser preview, can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/258)

## doc-include Enhancements :gift:

doc-include have been enhanced.
- :heavy_plus_sign: Pass dependencies (css/js) to a doc-include
- :heavy_plus_sign: New `onIncludeRendered` hook

- :heavy_plus_sign: Introduce a proxy for API requests to prevent CORS requests
- :heavy_plus_sign: Serving assets using a cdn url

You can find a more detailled description in the editor PR.

References:
  * [editor PR #2825](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2825)


## Editor Menu: New Config Options

It's now necessary to configure a docment search filter for a Menu. The search filter will be applied when you try to link a document to a menu entry.

### Needed Actions :fire:

If you want to keep the previous behavior, you'll have to add this filter to the Livingdocs Editor config.

**Example**

```js
// all.js
filters: {
  menuList: {
    displayFilters: [],
    defaultQueries: [
      {type: 'documentType', value: 'page'},
      {type: 'documentState', value: 'published'},
      {type: 'sortBy', value: 'relevance'}
    ],
    emptySearchQueries: [
      {type: 'documentType', value: 'page'},
      {type: 'documentState', value: 'published'},
      {type: 'sortBy', value: '-updated_at'}
    ]
  }
}
```

References:
  * [editor PR #2871](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2871)

## Design Versions

### Changes

The channel properties `available_versions` and `disabled_versions` are no longer checked on
- document create
- document update
- document publish

References:
  * [editor PR #2410](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2410)

## Auto update component with `doc-html` directive :fire:

### Changes
The html of a component with a `doc-html` directive will be applied and rendered automatically to a document in the Editor.
The Previous behaviour needed a confirmation to apply html content to a document.

References:
  * [editor PR #2917](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2917)

## Includes Feature :fire:

Includes API `resolveInclude` + `resolveRawInclude` returns now an object instead of a HTML string.

**Example**

```js
// Before
//   -> returns a HTML string
const includesApi = server.features.api('li-includes')
includesApi.resolveInclude({
  serviceName: 'old-resolve'
}, function (err, html) {
  expect(html).to.be.a.('string')
})
```

```js
// After
//   -> returns an object
const includesApi = server.features.api('li-includes')
includesApi.resolveInclude({
  serviceName: 'new-resolve'
}, function (err, include) {
  expect(include.html).to.be.a.('string')
})
```



# Prototypes

## IMatrics for NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis

We integrated IMatrics as a prototype:
- Integrated IMatrics in the Livingdocs Editor for NLP analysis of text.
- Allow users to configure IMatrics with a project through the channel config (plugin).
- Allow users to run analysis on text as well as showing a PoC of related articles.

# Highlights


##  New API for channel configurations :fire: :gift:

Added `li-channel-configs` feature.

The feature is disabled by default. To activate it add the following config:
```js
  channelConfigs: {
    enabled: true
  }
```

**Breaking change**:
  ```js
  // the return value `renderConfig` has changed:
  channelApi.getRenderConfig({channelId, contentType}, (err, renderConfig) => {})
  ```
  - property rename: `renderConfig.renditionsConfig -> renderConfig.renditions`

  - property added: `renderConfig.path` // absolute path to the render config. Can be required.

  - new methods: `renderConfig.isEmpty()` and `renderConfig.getAvailableRenditions()`

  Also requiring the render config is now delayed. Previously we would require
  the path which points to the render config file when initialising the projects
  feature. Now it is required at runtime whenever it is used. This means we do not update the loaded config anymore and it remains serialisable.

## Extend responses for the seed API :fire: :gift:

**Breaking change**: The "seedDocuments" method does no longer just return an array of document versions, but an object with:
  ```js
  type SeedDocumentsRes = {
    documents: DocumentVersion[],
    documentsBySeedId: { [seedDocumentId:number]: DocumentEntity }
  }
  const {documents: documentVersions, documentsBySeedId}: SeedDocumentsRes = await seedApi.seedDocuments(params, seedDocumentsData)
  ```
  This information turned out to be very useful and should be included in the return values.

[server #1921](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1921)


## Replace angular-ui-router with @uirouter/angularjs :fire: :wrench:

**Breaking change**: https://ui-router.github.io/guide/ng1/migrate-to-1_0

[editor #1842](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1842)


## Disable backwards-compatibility feature for component bindings. :fire: :wrench:

**Breaking change**: Check if your (downstream) editor creates directives/components e.g. `app.component`/`app.directive` and check/move bindings from the controller `constructor` to `$onInit`. More details you can find in the [migration guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes)

[editor #2027](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/2027)


## Enable single sign-on with external providers :gift:

It adds the possibility to signup (user registration) and signin (user authentication) using external OAuth 2 providers such as Github, Google or Facebook. When signining a user and its own project are created.

[server #1782](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1782) [editor #1913](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/1913)

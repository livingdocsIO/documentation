# Highlights


## Internal Document Links :tada:

When selecting text in the editor, the link tool in the editable toolbar allows to link to documents instead of URLs only. The input field is a combined input and detects if you want to search, or if you entered an URL.

Attention: The delivery needs a strategy to redirect id route patterns in order for inline links to work in the delivery.

- If you search, you get back a list of internal documents
- If you paste an URL that matches one of your deliveries, the link is automatically upgraded to a document reference.

## Custom Indexes / Queue Base Work :tada:

### Queue Base Work
To support all kind of features which need (job-)queues (now/future), we did some base work. These are the most important changes:
- Get rid of [bullmq](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq)
- Introduce [Redis streams](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3224) for messaging (more control/reliability/transparency)

### Custom Indexes
Some customers want to have their customised Elasticsearch publication index to make customised search requests. The switch to Redis streams was necessary to
make custom indexes possible. Why you could need a custom index and how to setup one, can be found [here](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/328).

**Migration Guide**
If you already have implemented a custom index in your downstream and want to replace it with the Livingdocs custom index solution, please contact us to make a planning. The upgrade is not difficult, but every customer is different and therefore it needs individual planning.

## More Secure Authentication Workflow :tada:

We worked on the security for the user authentication in Livingdocs. Some improvements are:

- Increased security for the accessTokens
- if an accessToken is stolen, it can't be used without a valid client cookie
- accessTokens can't renew themselves anymore
- an accessToken is bound to a valid client and session

For more information, read [here](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3225).

# Experimental

## Mobile - Inline Editing :tada:

With this release, we allow a user to inline add/edit components and its settings in the editor with your mobile. This is a MVP, but we will gradually improve the inline editing in the next few releases.

References:
  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3900)


## Editable Teasers :tada:

Editable teasers are embedded editable Livingdocs components. Technically editable teasers are doc-includes returning Livingdocs components, which can be edited like any other component. For more information read the [documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/354) and look into the [example](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3235) on the example-server.

Attention: Editable teasers do not work with the render pipeline v1 (which most of the customers are using at the moment). This should be fixed in an upcoming release.

  * [Documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/354)


## Videos :tada:

We introduce videos in Livingdocs with these abilities:

- upload videos and set metadata in media library
- upload videos and set metadata in editor via drag + drop / upload button
- import videos via public API
- Add project configuration for mediaVideo MediaType
- Add new directive `doc-video` in a Livingdocs design

In the upcoming releases we will bring in some improvements and make the video feature more stable.

## Drop Support for Elasticsearch < 6.8.5 :fire:

:fire: The support for Elasticsearch versions < 6.8.5 has been dropped. Please update your Elasticsearch cluster to Elasticsearch >= 6.8.5.

**Important!** You have to do an Elasticsearch update to >=6.8.5 before installing the December release. How to to a rolling upgrade is documented [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html).


References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3275)

## Elasticsearch Indexes :fire:

#### Server Configuration
- 🔥 moved server config `search.articlePublicationIndexEnabled` to `elasticIndex.documentPublicationIndexEnabled`
- 🔥 removed server config `search.articlePublicationIndex`. The publication index name is now auto generated: `${indexNamePrefix}-li-document-publications-index`

#### CLI
- 🔥 removed `livingdocs-server es-publication-delete-index` use `livingdocs-server elasticsearch-delete-index --handle=li-publications -y` instead
- 🔥 removed `livingdocs-server es-publication-reindex` use `livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-publications -y` instead

#### Environment Config

We automatically create a publication index for the public API. Therefore you **must** define an `indexNamePrefix` for every environment. The definition of `indexNamePrefix` is free, but we suggest a pattern like `${your-company}-${environment}`.

🔥  Define an `indexNamePrefix` for every environment

```js
elasticIndex: {

  // every index name will be prefixed to prevent name clashes
  // the index will be created with this pattern: `${indexNamePrefix}-${handle}-index`
  indexNamePrefix: 'your-company-local',
}
```

#### Publication Index for public API

🔥 Run a background index job for the publication index

To support future updates, we did an internal update where we define Elasticsearch aliases pointing on an index. With this change, you need to re-index the publication index used for the public API search endpoint.

After the deployment, please **immediately** run this CLI task (the publication index will be empty after the deployment):

```bash
livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-publications -y
```

#### public API publications search

🔥  When using the public API search endpoint (`/api/v1/publications/search`), then you have to reindex all publications, with the command `livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-publications -y`.

When you start the new server version, the publication index is empty. To use the publication index in production for the public API as fast as possible, you have 2 options:

- 1) Start a sidekick container with the new server version and make a full background index with `livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-publications -y`. As soon as it's done, you can start your casual servers with the new server version
- 2) If you want to deploy/start your new server version without a preparation step, you can index the most recent publication with an additional parameter `--since`. For example `livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-publications --since 1m -y` does indexing all publications published within the last month. As soon as you're done with this indexing step, you can run another background without `--since` argument to index all publications.


## Authentication
With the improved [authentication workflow](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3225), we have some additional breaking changes.

🔥 third party applications / e2e-tests may need some adaptions correctly supporting cookies

🔥 Local development on Chrome now requires a SSL setup for authentication to work. Setting up [a certificate locally](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/blob/master/config/cert.js) and proxying requests using the [editor environment](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/blob/master/config/environments/local.js#L14) config is advised.
```js
// advised configs for local development
module.exports= {
  // https is not _required_ but there may be some complications such as cookies being filtered when trying to overwrite secure cookies or other behavior that's dependant on the browser vendor
  https: require('../cert'),
  api: {
    // disabling the proxiedHost config (CORS-mode)
    // will only work in production
    // or a server with a valid SSL setup
    proxiedHost: 'http://localhost:9090'
  }
}
```

🔥 all requests need to allow sending credentials or forward cookies if requests are made with user/project tokens. (API Tokens should still work exactly as before!)

🔥 (3rd-party) applications that use the /auth/local/login endpoint, need to support cookies. It should be as easy as forwarding the liClient cookie.

🔥 For security reasons CORS is now disabled by default. We encourage a more secure approach where we forward a path on the editor domain to the server instance. For Example: ’https://edit.livingdocs.io/proxy/api/' should be forwarded to ‘https://server.livingdocs.io’
- This guards against CSRF attacks
- Latency improvements as requests are halved (no more OPTIONS requests)
- Cookies are more secure due to the possibility of using the sameSite: 'strict' option.

#### API Changes
🔥 removed authApi.getLoginHistory

🔥 removed authApi.revokeAccessTokensOfUser

🔥 removed authApi.reissueAccessToken

🔥 removed authApi.revokeAccessToken

🔥 changed authApi.createAccessTokenForTests -> authApi._createAccessTokenForTests | now returns token instead of {token}

🔥 move authApi.authorizationMiddleware out of the authApi and do not expose it anymore

🔥 Removed authUtils. authenticationSuccess (The promise version is still the same)

Routes
🔥 /authenticate has moved to /auth/local/login

🔥 /users/me has moved to /auth/me

🔥 removed POST /authenticate/refresh

🔥 removed POST /token/revoke

🔥 removed POST /token/reissue -> access tokens are reissued on /auth/me now

🔥 removed POST /token/revoke-tokens

🔥 changed GET /users/:id does not return a login history anymore


## SSO Logins :fire:

With the improved [authentication workflow](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3225), we have some additional [breaking changes](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-planning/issues/4140) for SSO Logins. If the callback URL for SSO does not match the editorUrl, we set the auth cookies for a wrong domain leading to issues when logging in.

**Migrating an existing SSO login**

With cookies being set on a new URL, the SSO Logins need to be re-configured. Do the following:

1. Make sure your `editor__public_host` env variable is set to the editor URL (e.g. `https://edit.livingdocs.io`)
2. Change all callback URLs for your SSO provider to the pattern `https://{editorUrl}/proxy/auth/{provider}/callback`. For the Livingdocs service this looked e.g. as follows: `auth__connections__github__config__callbackURL = https://edit.livingdocs.io/proxy/auth/github/callback`. (NOTE: depending on your traefik setup it might also require `proxy/api` instead of `/proxy`).
3. In the settings for your social providers, allow the new callback URLs (for FB for example we had to allow the redirect URL `https://edit.livingdocs.io/proxy/auth/facebook/callback` in our Facebook app)



## Migration to Redis Streams :fire:

- :fire: Existing messages from `bull` won't be processed anymore.
- :fire: If you had pending index or imports, you'll need to restart them. Our whole setup already supported retries everywhere except in the importer of the public api. It's probably best if you re-trigger the imports after deployment.
- ❌ Removed bull dashboard and replaced it with an operations screen in the admin interface of the editor.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3224)

## Slug Metadata in Slug Routing Pattern :fire:

If you activated the routing feature and if you are using a route pattern containing `:slug` and at the same time you have a metadata property with the handle `slug` the behavior will change in such a way that the route pattern for `:slug` will be built out of the `slug` metadata property value and not the document title. In most cases this is what you want. If it is not, you can rename the handle of your existing slug metadata property to prevent clashes.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3227)

## DocumentsApi - Removed functions :fire:

- :fire: Removed `DocumentEntity.find` and `DocumentEntity.findById` methods, please use the official apis
- :fire: Removed `RevisionEntity.find` and `RevisionEntity.findById` methods, please use the official apis
- :fire: Changed parameters of `documentApi.getLocks` from `(documentId)` to `({projectId, documentId})`, so we can save a few roundtrips to check whether a user is allowed to access the document.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3237)

## S3 Storage Default :fire:

:fire: The S3 default changed from `{ACL: 'public-read'}` to `undefined` - it now uses the bucket ACL-defaults.

#### How to revert to the behaviour before the release :fire:
To restore the behaviour you can explicitly pass the `{ACL: 'public-read'}` in `(images|files).storage.config.params.ACL`

```js
storage: {
  strategy: 's3',
  config: {
    bucket: 'li-bucket-dev',
    region: 'eu-central-1',
    accessKeyId: 'secret',
    secretAccessKey: 'secret',
    params: {
      ACL: 'public-read' // <--------- add this to go back to the old behavior
    }
  }
}
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3262)

## DocumentRelationApi - Changed Params :fire:

🔥 Changed params on `documentRelationApi.setDocumentEmbedReferences` from `(documentVersion)` to `({documentVersion, trx})`

NOTE: The new param `trx` is optional and only necessary if you want to call within a transactional context. If you do pass it, you are responsible to call `trx.commit` or `trx.rollback` when you're done.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3259)

## Index Feature - Removed publicationTransformModule :fire:

- 🔥 Remove server config option search.indexer.publicationTransformModule
- 🔥 Remove parameter publication-transform-module in livingdocs-server es-publication-reindex task

Note: This change should have no consequences for customers.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3222)

## Index Feature - Removed/Renamed Functions :fire:

- 🔥 Removed `req.accessToken` from all requests. Please migrate to `req.verifiedToken.bearerToken`
- 🔥 Removed `searchManager.putDocument`. Please migrate to `indexingApi.addJob` that executes the same method internally

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3187)

## Security - User access tokens require valid cookies

- 🔥 Cypress helpers need some adaptions to correctly support cookies.

Our core implementation can serve as reference for a cypress login helper: https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/blob/master/cypress/support/liLogin.js/#L69

- 🔥 All requests against the server using an user access token require a valid session and the cookies that belong to it.

You may need to allow credentials or forwarding cookies if you have been working with User tokens. _(API Tokens should still work exactly as before!)_

Example an `axios` instance using the withCredentials flag
```
const axios = require('axios').create({..., withCredentials: true})
```

## Editor CSS Class Renamings :fire:

:fire: If you've done CSS modifications based on the original upstream classes in the editor please look into this PR. We did a lot of small refactorings/renamings.

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/4015)

## CSS Stylesheets vh is not supported anymore :fire:
Because of changes in the editor we need to replace the vh unit in the design assets. This is done automatically but the css assets in the design should support CORS when the files are on a different domain then your Livingdocs Editor. Otherwise we can't read the CSS Rules and it can lead to an unexpected behavior in the editor.
If CORS can't be enabled on the css assets it should be replaced with a unit which does not directly base on the height of the viewport.

# Internal Changes

## Beta Endpoints for Publications :gift:

We added a new base endpoint `/api/beta/`. This allows us to expose things on the public API we are not
sure enough yet, to introduce it on the `v1` endpoint that we can never break.

The first 2 introduced beta endpoints are already existing and have the same format on `v1`, but extend the response
with `references`. This might break in the future.

New endpoints:
- :gift: `GET /api/beta/documents/:documentId/latestPublication`
- :gift: `GET /api/beta/documents/latestPublications`

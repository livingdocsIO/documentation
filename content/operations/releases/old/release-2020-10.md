# Highlights

## New APIs :tada:

We added numerous APIs for the 'public API', 'livingdocs-server CLI' and we have good progress with the Angular to Vue
transition. Find more in the [APIs](#apis-gift) section of the release notes.

## WoodWing Assets Integration :tada:

Adds a basic WoodWing integration into Livingdocs:
- Support drag+drop from WoodWing assets to Livingdocs
- Whenever an image is uploaded to Livingdocs, it's also uploaded to WoodWing assets with some basic metadata.

  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3771)
  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3079)

Related: We also implemented an open-source boilerplate for a [Livingdocs to WoodWing Studio transformer](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-to-woodwing-exporter) as an AWS serverless app.


## Referenced Documents :tada:

We harmonized the visual appearance for document references in the editor e.g.
- media library document references
- 'copy of' / 'embedded in' on the publish screen
- ...more will follow in the next releases

  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3796)
  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3140)


## Parallel Image Upload :tada:

We improved the image uploading process for cases when the user needs to provide image metadata before an image can be uploaded.

The improvements are:
- Upload multiple images in parallel
- Edit metadata for multiple images at once
- Cancel single uploads

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/821875/92760343-da357c80-f390-11ea-878e-d29b44285db2.png)

Look at this [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3814) for some impressions.



## Image Service 2.0 :tada:

Livingdocs supports mechanisms to crop images and serve images in an optimised way to browsers and devices. This is done by uploading an original image and then cropping or resizing it on the fly through a SaaS image service.
We improved this process, e.g.
- integrate your own image service by registering a url building function
- improved the possibilities to configure the image rendering process

For more details read the [image service evaluation guide](https://docs.livingdocs.io/evaluation-guide/image-services) or the [documentation diff](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/330).

# Breaking Changes :fire:

## Migrate the database

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database schema
# migration - 139-fix-title-on-media-library-entries.js
#   set title on media_library_entries table
# migration - 140-migration-log.js
#   create table document_migration_log
# migration - 141-drop-document_migrations_field.js
#   drop NOT NULL condition on document_migrations.legacy_design_version
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

## Resrc.it Image Service

When using `resrc.it` as image service, one needs to set its render strategy in the server configuration:

```js
'resrc.it': {
  quality: 75,
  host: 'https://app.resrc.it',

  // new options
  imgTagRenderStrategy: 'resrcit',
  anyTagRenderStrategy: 'resrcit'
}
```

# Deprecations

## Deprecate asset management server config

Pull Request: [livingdocs-server #3086](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3086)

- ⏳ Deprecated static server config `assetManagement`. Rename `assetManagement` to `mediaLibrary`
- ⏳ Remove property `assetManagement.enabled` (currently it only throws a deprecation message)
- ⏳ Remove property `assetManagement.googleVision` (currently it only throws a deprecation message)

## Deprecate MediaLibrary paginationSize

Pull Request: [livingdocs-server #3092](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3092)

- ⏳ deprecate static server config `mediaLibrary.paginationSize`. The config will be removed in the next releases but has already no effect anymore. We use an internal default of 35.

## Data Migrations

Pull Request: [livingdocs-server #3151](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3151) :gift:

- ⏳ `grunt data-migration-create-and-prepare` should not be used anymore. The task has been replaced with `livingdocs-server data-migration-run`
- ⏳ `grunt data-migration-accept` should not be used anymore. The task has been replaced with `livingdocs-server data-migration-run`




# APIs :gift:

## Register Custom Vue Display Filter :gift:

One can register a Vue component as a custom display filter (e.g. on a dashboard).

References:
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/317)
  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3777)

## Customise Editor UI with Vue for Doc Includes :gift:

Implement a [custom Editor UI](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/includes/editor_customization) for doc-includes with Vue.

References:
  * [Documentation (custom Editor UI)](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/des/editor_customization)
  * [Documentation (Twitter Example)](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs/pull/312)
  * [Documentation (doc-include)](https://docs.livingdocs.io/evaluation-guide/intro#summary-of-a-doc-include)
  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3768)
  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3098)


## Public API - Media Library Endpoints :gift:

The public API contains new endpoints for the media library.

Examples:
- `GET /api/v1/mediaLibrary/:id`
- `GET /api/v1/mediaLibrary?ids=1,2,3` or `GET /api/v1/mediaLibrary?externalId=foo&systemName=comyan`

References:
  * Documentation - 'https://your-editor.com/public-api'
  * [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/3895)

## Public API - Expose Public API via the server API :gift:

Get access to the public API via server API
- `const publicApi = liServer.features.api('li-public-api')`

References:
  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3138)


## Public API - Support client defined documentId in the import API :gift:

During a migration of an existing system, it's best practice to migrate all entries of the old system into livingdocs.
To ease the migration, we want to support user-defined identifiers, so a custom import script can reuse existing identifiers.

References:
  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3145)
  * [Documentation](TODO Marc)


## Livingdocs-server CLI - Simplify data migrations :gift:

Added a new CLI task `livingdocs-server data-migration-run`. `data-migration-run` combines `grunt data-migration-create-and-prepare` and `grunt data-migration-accept` into one step.
Improvements:
- migrate multiple design versions in one step to a target design version (e.g. 1.0.0 + 1.0.1 to 2.0.0)
- add `--filter-by-content-type` filter to migrations
- Get a manual and examples when executing `livingdocs-server data-migration-run` on the terminal
- Show a specific migration report for either a version bump or a data migration

References:
  * [Server PR - data-migration-run](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3151)
  * [Server PR - report](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3148)

## Livingdocs-server CLI - Improve reindex tasks :gift:

New options are supported
- `livingdocs-server es-search-reindex` supports a project filter, e.g. `--project=magazine`
- `livingdocs-server es-publication-reindex` supports a project filter, e.g. `--project=magazine`
- `livingdocs-server es-publication-reindex` supports a contentType filter, e.g. `--content-type=regular`

  * [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3162)

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

**Attention:** If you skipped one or more releases, please also check the release-notes of the skipped ones.

### Working Title

Managing the title of an article inside and outside of the newsroom has been a challenge in the past. The public Article Title can change throughout an articles' lifetime. The Working Title feature allows for a clear separation between the internal newsroom title (Working Title) and the public Article Title in the published frontend. With this separation in the Editor, the public representation of the Article Title can be changed without affecting the internal Working Title.

However, in some cases it's desired to keep the Working Title and Article Title in sync. To accomplish that, we introduced the [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}) Content Type configuration, which allows to compute a readonly version of the Working Title based on other metadata fields.

### Concurrent License Model: Billing Report

Concurrent License Model has been introduced to Livingdocs. Users' requests to the Livingdocs Server are timestamped for reporting purposes. A background job aggregates  this timestamps in 30-minute buckets as concurrent users. Billing Report view will now report a new column with maximum concurrent users per month.

```

## Deprecations

### Back to Standard

:exclamation: Check the [Back to Standard Roadmap]({{< ref "/customising/back-to-standard" >}}) and inform you about important upcoming deprecations and breaking changes and reasons.

### Porting `useAsTitle` to `displayTitlePattern`
The `useAsTitle` option has been deprecated and **will be removed in `release-2023-07`**.
If you are currently using an `li-text` plugin with `useAsTitle: true`, please migrate to [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}). You will want to remove the `useAsTitle` from the metadata and introduce `displayTitlePattern: '{{metadata.title}}'` to maintain the functionality, where `title` is handle for an `li-text` plugin. Please bear in mind that Editor toolbar behaviour will change, and it will no longer be possible to change the title of the article from the toolbar. The title will be editable in the `li-text` plugin. Please also make sure that `document.title` is no longer accessed in custom code, e.g. in Includes since this would leak the internal Working Title to the public.

### Rename mediaIndex to indexing

Rename `your-metadata-plugin.mediaIndex` to `your-metadata-plugin.indexing`


```js
// migrate your metadata plugins from
mediaIndex: {
  enabled: true,
  index_behavior: []
}

// to
indexing: {
  enabled: true,
  behavior: []
}
```

Breaking Change: `release-2023-07`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5365)


### behaveAsLiImage

Deprecate `behaveAsLiImage` for custom metadata plugins. Replace your custom image metadata plugins with `li-image`

Breaking Change: `release-2023-07`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6695)

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-29017](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jxr-cg7f-gpgv) patched in `vm2` v3.9.16
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2023-30547](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch3r-j5x3-6q2m) patched in `vm2` v3.9.17

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488) patched in `webpack` v5.76.0

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

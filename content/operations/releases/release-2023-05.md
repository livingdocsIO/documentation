## Features

- German UI
- Document Access Control
- Issue Management: Navigation and Preview
- [Metadata Preview]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#metadata-previews" >}})
- [Working Title]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}})
- Document Editing Toolbar

### German UI

To enable the German UI in the Editor, you have to set `locale` in the Editor config.
```js
app: {
  locale: 'de'
}
```

In future, you will be able to configure your own labels for metadata properties in several languages, allowing individual users to switch between languages at their discretion for complete multi-language UI experience.

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 187-indexes-deferrable.js
#   modifies constraints to be deferrable
# migration 188-document_content_types-archive.js
#   adds a new table to store archived content types
# migration 189-delete-draft-project-config-indexes.js
#   removes draft project config indexes
# migration 190-enable-preview-builds.js
#   adds a new column to store the preview build status
# migration 191-add-concurrent-user-tracking.js
#   adds a new table to store concurrent user information
# migration 193-increase-document-title-length.js
#   increases the length of the document title to 1000 characters
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Add default settings for Editor Config :fire:

editor.imageCrop.showSurroundingImage: 'always'
editor.imageCrop.surroundingImageOpacity: 0.25
editor.imageCrop.zoomStep: 1.1

editor.printView.zoomStep: 1.2
auth.authTokenRenewalInterval: 0
app.locale: 'en'
app.dateTimeLocale: 'en-li'
app.documentLists.pageSize: 100
app.documentList.pageSize: 100
app.history.pageSize: 100
admin.showBilling: true
port: 9000
host: '::'
loglevel: 'warn'
basePath: '/'
compress: false
assetsMaxAge: '1y'
h2c: false
redirectHttpToHttps: true
contentSecurityPolicy: `frame-ancestors 'self';`
```

})
```

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5632)

### Metadata Plugin li-issue-management

- :fire: metadata type `li-issue-management`: requires `finiteProducts` in the root of the project config from now on. See [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-issue-management" >}})

**Project Config**

```diff
   v: 2,
+  finiteProducts: [{
+    issueContentType: 'issue',
+    issueMemberContentTypes: ['page']
+  }],
   ...
```

- :fire: metadata type `li-issue-management`: requires `config: {index: true},` metadata config from now on. See [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-issue-management" >}})

```diff
   handle: 'local',
   type: 'li-issue-management',
+  config: {index: true},
   ui: {
```

Adding `index: true` config requires elasticsearch to be re-indexed:

```bash
livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index --handle=li-documents -y
```

## Deprecations

### Porting `useAsTitle` to `displayTitlePattern`
The `useAsTitle` option has been deprecated and **will be removed in `release-2023-07`**.
If you are currently using an `li-text` plugin with `useAsTitle: true`, please migrate to [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}). You will want to remove the `useAsTitle` from the metadata and introduce `displayTitlePattern: '{{metadata.title}}'` to maintain the functionality, where `title` is handle for an `li-text` plugin. Please bear in mind that Editor toolbar behaviour will change, and it will no longer be possible to change the title of the article from the toolbar. The title will be editable in the `li-text` plugin. Please also make sure that `document.title` is no longer accessed in custom code, e.g. in Includes since this would leak the internal Working Title to the public.

### Rename mediaIndex to indexing

Rename `your-metadata-plugin.mediaIndex` to `your-metadata-plugin.indexing`


```js
// migrate your metadata plugins from
mediaIndex: {
  enabled: true,
  index_behavior: []
}

// to
indexing: {
  enabled: true,
  behavior: []
}
```

Breaking Change: `release-2023-07`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5365)


### behaveAsLiImage

Deprecate `behaveAsLiImage` for custom metadata plugins. Replace your custom image metadata plugins with `li-image`

Breaking Change: `release-2023-07`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6695)

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-29017](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jxr-cg7f-gpgv) patched in `vm2` v3.9.16
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2023-30547](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch3r-j5x3-6q2m) patched in `vm2` v3.9.17

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488) patched in `webpack` v5.76.0

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

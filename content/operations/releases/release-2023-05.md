## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Patched vulnerabilities

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.
### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-29017](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jxr-cg7f-gpgv) patched in `vm2` v3.9.16
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2023-30547](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch3r-j5x3-6q2m) patched in `vm2` v3.9.17

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488) patched in `webpack` v5.76.0

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

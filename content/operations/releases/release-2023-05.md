## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

### Working Title

Managing the title of an article inside and outside of the newsroom has been a challenge in the past. The public Article Title can change throughout an articles' lifetime. The Working Title feature allows for a clear separation between the internal newsroom title (Working Title) and the public Article Title in the published frontend. With this separation in the Editor, the public representation of the Article Title can be changed without affecting the internal Working Title.

However, in some cases it's desired to keep the Working Title and Article Title in sync. To accomplish that, we introduced the [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}) Content Type configuration, which allows to compute a readonly version of the Working Title based on other metadata fields.

* [Documentation - displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}})

## Breaking Changes :fire:

:exclamation: Check the [Back to Standard Roadmap]({{< ref "/customising/back-to-standard" >}}) and inform you about important upcoming deprecations and breaking changes and reasons.

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

TODO: check migration

### Add default settings for Editor Config :fire:

:fire: Obsolete configs which can be removed from downstream editor environment configs

```js
api.version
app.useGravatar
admin.showServiceInfo
pusher
```

:recycle: You can remove theses settings from your Downstream Editor Config if the value is identical (because it's defined as default values)

```js
debug: false
http.timeout: 10000
versionCheckTimeout: null
editor.imageCrop.showSurroundingImage: 'always'
editor.imageCrop.surroundingImageOpacity: 0.25
editor.imageCrop.zoomStep: 1.1
editor.printView.enableStepZooming: true
editor.printView.zoomStep: 1.2
auth.authTokenRenewalInterval: 0
app.locale: 'en'
app.dateTimeLocale: 'en-li'
app.documentLists.pageSize: 100
app.documentList.pageSize: 100
app.history.pageSize: 100
admin.showBilling: true
port: 9000
host: '::'
loglevel: 'warn'
basePath: '/'
compress: false
assetsMaxAge: '1y'
h2c: false
redirectHttpToHttps: true
contentSecurityPolicy: `frame-ancestors 'self';`
```

## Deprecations

:exclamation: Check the [Back to Standard Roadmap]({{< ref "/customising/back-to-standard" >}}) and inform you about important upcoming deprecations and breaking changes and reasons.

### Porting `useAsTitle` to `displayTitlePattern`
The `useAsTitle` option has been deprecated and **will be removed in `release-2023-07`**.
If you are currently using an `li-text` plugin with `useAsTitle: true`, please migrate to [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}). You will want to remove the `useAsTitle` from the metadata and introduce `displayTitlePattern: '{{metadata.title}}'` to maintain the functionality, where `title` is handle for an `li-text` plugin. Please bear in mind that Editor toolbar behaviour will change, and it will no longer be possible to change the title of the article from the toolbar. The title will be editable in the `li-text` plugin. Please also make sure that `document.title` is no longer accessed in custom code, e.g. in Includes since this would leak the internal Working Title to the public.

### Rename mediaIndex to indexing

Rename `your-metadata-plugin.mediaIndex` to `your-metadata-plugin.indexing`

TODO:
- What does metadata.indexing already support? (only media library index?)
- Can I migrate metadata.publicationIndex to metadata.indexing? Is the behavior of the application different? What ES indexes are affected?
- Can I already influence the documenation index?
- * [Dynamic metadata for Publication indexing](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5362) -> what does contentTypes.metadata[{type: 'li-text', config: {index: true}}] do?

```js
// migrate your metadata plugins from
mediaIndex: {
  enabled: true,
  index_behavior: []
}

// to
indexing: {
  enabled: true,
  behavior: []
}
```

## Patched vulnerabilities

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-29017](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7jxr-cg7f-gpgv) patched in `vm2` v3.9.16
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2023-30547](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch3r-j5x3-6q2m) patched in `vm2` v3.9.17

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-0842](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0842) patched in `xml2js` v0.5.0
* [CVE-2022-37603](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3rfm-jhwj-7488) patched in `webpack` v5.76.0

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Highlights

### Focal Point Cropping

Automatic crops are a great way to define multiple crops of an image, but automatic crops could cut off the important subject in the image. There is where focal point cropping comes into the game by letting users choose where in the image the main subject is and all automatic crops will make sure it is visible in the frame.

* [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/media-library/media-library-setup/#focal-point-cropping)
* [PR: Focal point selection for images](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5916)

### Push Messages

A new metadata plugin which does all the User Interface and database work required to send Push Messages,
but gives you the control over what and how to send.

- Send Push Messages directly from Table Dashboards
- Dynamic message format based on Params Schema
- Implement your own push function to send messages anywhere

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-push-messages" >}})
* [PR: Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5833)
* [PR: Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4829)

### Public API - Open API Specification

The [Livingdocs Public API]({{< ref "/reference/public-api" >}}) can be tested and consumed with an [OpenAPI v3 specification file](https://livingdocsio.github.io/openapi/livingdocs-openapi.json).

Thanks to the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/), it's possible to quickly test the API using [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://livingdocsio.github.io/openapi/livingdocs-openapi.json). And import the full collection of existing API endpoints into Insomnia or Postman.

### System Metadata

Livingdocs supports configurable metadata since a long time. In this release, we're introducing "System Metadata" properties, which have different versioning behavior and don't affect the draft state. This is useful for metadata properties that are not part of the content, but are used for internal purposes. Typically System Metadata Properties are used for behavioral extensions of the Livingdocs system, like Proofreading tasks or Push Notifications and other extensions. At the moment this is an internal feature and only specific properties use this functionality.

* [PR: System Metadata Preparation](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4735)
* [PR: System Metadata Preparation II](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4778)
* [PR: System Metadata](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4807)

### Document Lists Sync (Autorefresh)

Collaboratively managing Document Lists became much easier. Livingdocs now synchronises all changes so any user always sees the latest version of a Document List. Therefore, no more conflicting changes resulting in error messages and tedious reloads will occur.

* [PR: List Sync](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5853)
* [PR: Sync Notification](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5941)

### Cut and paste Components

Cutting and pasting components makes reordering components within a long document much easier. Cutting components moves them into the Clipboard from where they can be dragged to their new position.

* [PR: Cut and paste components](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5824)

### Metadata Plugin li-document-references

To replace the existing `li-reference-list` metadata plugin with it's more modern variant, `li-document-references` is introduced. It allows a more flexible configuration for the dashboard in use to search documents by the means of the `useDashboard` config as you know it from `li-document-reference`.

* [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-document-references)
* [PR: Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4871)
* [PR: Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5873)

### Roles for Read and Write Instances

We introduce `roles` to define the type of server
- `read` (all server have read access by default)
- `write` (stores data)
- `worker` (executes jobs like indexing)

* [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/server/roles/)
* [PR: Roles](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4814)

### Reindexing CLI task improvements

Elasticsearch Indexing CLI (`livingdocs-server elasticsearch-index`) got some improvements:
- add `--ids=1,2,3,4` argument to index specific document id's
- add `--ids-file=file-with-ids.txt` argument to index specific document id's passed by a file
- add `--since=2022-10-11` argument to index changes since a specific iso date
- add `--until=1h` argument to index changes until a relative time or iso date
- add `--wait` flag to wait for index completion. The processing still only takes place in other processes, not in the cli process.

* [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4837)

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
# migration 182-add-started_at-index-on-users_occupations.js
#   add index on user_occupations.started_at
# migration 183-add-user_id-index-on-users_occupations.js
#   add index on user_occupations.user_id
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Fix firstPublicationDate to documents table (Post Deployment) :fire:

If you have unpublished a document while running release-2022-07 or release-2022-09 then you may have inaccurate values for the `document.systemdata.firstPublicationDate`. Below is a comparison of the change in the four most recent versions:

First publish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Set `firstPublicationDate`

Republish while published:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Keep `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Remove `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Republish after unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Essentially the old behaviour and the new "fixed" behaviour is to set `firstPublicationDate` once and never modify it. This property will still exist even when the document is unpublished. For release-2022-07 and release-2022-09 the difference in behaviour was that the `firstPublicationDate` would be cleared on unpublish and set again at the next publish.

If you would like to correct the `firstPublicationDate` property for all of your articles you can run:
```bash
node ./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/009-fix-first-publication-date.js
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Check that `first_publication_id` has been set (same as the script 007-populate-first-publication-data.js)
2. Move `firstPublicationDate` from `data` to `data.publishControl`
3. Remove `data.firstPublicationDate`
4. If `firstPublicationDate` is not set then use the value from the first publication
5. If `firstPublicationDate` is set then use the value from the first publication when the first publication is older

It is highly recommended that you run this script because it is performing a data migration as well as fixing the values.

### Drop Elasticsearch v6 :fire:

[Drop support for Elasticsearch v6](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4907).
Please upgrade to Elasticsearch v8 or OpenSearch v2.3.0.

### Separation of Revision Metadata and System Metadata :fire:

We introduce "System Metadata" for data which only needs to be stored per document and need no history like the existing Revision Metadata. Typically System Metadata are used for handling state on a document like proofreading, language settings, integration settings and a lot more.

- :fire: Metadata object spread not supported
  Object spread using `{...documentVersion.metadata}` is not supported anymore for `documentWriteModel.metadata` and `documentVersion.metadata`. Please use `{...documentVersion.metadata.toJSON()}` instead.
  This has the side effect in the tests that `expect(metadata).to.deep.equal({title: 'foo'})` doesn't work anymore. Either call `.toJSON()` on the object or use a clone function that clones all the enumerable properties instead of just own properties.
- :fire: Content types removed from a project config not served in public api
  The public API now only serves configured content types. Before it also served documents of removed content types, which resulted in inconsistencies when a certain set of metadata was expected.
- :fire: Unconfigured metadata properties are not exposed anymore on `documentVersion.metadata`
  `documentVersion.metadata` now only includes configured metadata properties. Before the changes in here it contained all metadata properties, also ones that got removed from the metadata configuration of the project config. Therefore `JSON.stringify(document.metadata)` now only renders configured properties.
- :fire: Move `preparePublish` hooks after metadata plugin `onPreparePublish` hooks
  During the migration to the preparePublish hooks, the order [accidentally](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/blob/b5b125709f89973891cb4422427e8c2e2a34ec98/app/features/documents/publication/publication_api.js#L84-L85) changed. Before, the prePublish hooks were run after the metadata plugin onPublish hooks.
  In this [change](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/blob/eafbddafd88d9d4b909a70ab404f4df259804534/app/features/documents/entities/documents-repo.js#L241-L247), we're reverting that to execute the metadata plugin onPreparePublish hooks before the preparePublish hooks.
  This has the effect that required metadata are always present in the preparePublish hooks, unlike before where they still could be missing.

### Break metadata plugin li-desknet-integration | li-transcoding-state :fire:

* :fire: `ui.component` option for `li-transcoding-state` metadata plugin has been removed (it uses a default component)
* :fire: `ui.component` option for `li-desknet-integration` metadata plugin has been removed (it uses a default component)

### IndexingApi background indexing job :fire:

Remove `indexingApi.addPublicationBackgroundIndexingJobsByIds`.
Please use `indexIndexingApi.addBackgroundIndexingJobsByIds` that supports also cluster parameters.

```diff
- indexIndexingApi.addPublicationBackgroundIndexingJobsByIds({
-   context: {projectId: 1},
-   ids
- })
+ indexIndexingApi.addBackgroundIndexingJobsByIds({
+   handle: 'custom-index-handle',
+   context: {projectId: 1},
+   ids
+ })
```

* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4837)

### Remove Regex support in Delivery :fire:

Remove any regular expressions from `pathPattern` configs and update them according to our [examples](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/project-config/deliveries/#pathpattern).

* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5908)


### Remove li-desknet-platforms metadata plugin :fire:

The metadata plugin `li-desknet-platforms` has been replaced by `li-desknet-schedule`, which has a different storage schema and additional config options.

- :fire: Remove li-desknet-platforms metadata plugin

**Required Actions**

If you have been using the `li-desknet-platforms` metadata plugin you will need to change to the `li-desknet-schedule` plugin and migrate the data to the new format. The metadata storage schema has changed from:

```js
[
  {
    platformId: 1,
    categoryId: 2
  }
]
```
to:
```js
{
  platforms: [
    {
      platformId: 1,
      categoryId: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

If you would like to migrate the data from "li-desknet-platforms" to "li-desknet-schedule" then you will need to write a [migration script](https://docs.livingdocs.io/guides/documents/document-design/data-migrations/) which moves the current metadata value to the platforms property of the new metadata value object:

```js
module.exports = {
  async migrateAsync ({metadata}) {
    // skip the revision from being migrated when deskNetPlatforms is not set
    if (!metadata.desknetPlatforms) return

    metadata.desknetSchedule = {platforms: metadata.desknetPlatforms}
    metadata.desknetPlatforms = undefined
    return {metadata}
  }
}
```

* [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4799)

### Standardise the alt text and directive prefilling :fire:

:fire: Change the processing order of altTextPrefilling and componentDirectivesPrefilling so that the result is more understandable.

If multiple prefill configs are provided for the same directive in `componentDirectivesPrefilling`, then the first match found will be used instead of continuing and overwriting other previously successful matches. Additionally, there is no longer a priority given to translatable metadata fields, so the order of the `componentDirectivesPrefilling` and `altTextPrefilling` configs should be more predictable - the first match in the array will always be used.

**Required Actions**
If you have multiple prefill configs for a single directive in `componentDirectivesPrefilling` then you should change the order so that the highest priority configs are first in the array.

* [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5821)


## Deprecations

### Systemdata

💣 Normalize `documentWriteModel.systemdata` and `documentVersion.systemdata`. Old properties are defined as getters and emit deprecation warnings (`LIDEP018`), new properties are enumerable on the object.

- `systemdata.project_id` > `systemdata.projectId`
- `systemdata.channel_id` > `systemdata.channelId`
- `systemdata.document_id` > `systemdata.documentId`
- `systemdata.revision_id` > `systemdata.revisionId`
- `systemdata.remote_id` > `systemdata.remoteId`
- `systemdata.content_type` > `systemdata.contentType`
- `systemdata.document_type` > `systemdata.documentType`
- `systemdata.designDescriptor` > `systemdata.design`
- `systemdata.publication_id` > `systemdata.publicationId`
- `systemdata.publication_date` > `systemdata.lastPublicationDate`
- `systemdata.first_publication_date` > `systemdata.firstPublicationDate`

### HTTP Server Config

To make the HTTP Config more consistent we [moved](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4830) the settings to another server config property.

```js
// from
server: {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 9090,
  max_json_request_size: '500kb',
  gzip: false,
  trust_proxy: 'loopback,uniquelocal,172.17.0.0/24'
},

// to
httpServer: {
  //   defaults, you can omit those
  host: '::', // this is the http listen config. if you declare 'localhost', it won't be possible to access it outside the host.
  port: 9090,
  maxRequestBodySize: '500kb',
  useGzipCompression: false,
  xForwardedForTrustIps: 'loopback,uniquelocal,172.17.0.0/24',

  //   optionally define unix socket path or ssl certificates
  //   path: '/path/to/unix/socket',
  //   https: {key, cert},
},
```

## System Requirements

### Suggested

{{< system-versions list="suggested" >}}

### Minimal

{{< system-versions list="minimal" >}}

## Deployment

### Before the deployment

No pre-deployment steps are required before rolling out this release.

### Rollout deployment

#### Migrate the Postgres Database

No migrations are required for this release.

### After the deployment

No post-deployment steps are required after rolling out this release.

### Rollback

No rollback steps are required for this release.

### Add Postgres Lock Timeout of 2s for read & write roles :gift:

To improve system resilience and avoid query pile-ups during lock contention, we configure a default lock timeout of `2 seconds` for all application database roles.
This `lockTimeout` value can be configured, if needed.
This ensures that queries waiting on row-level locks will automatically fail after 2 seconds instead of blocking indefinitely.

Note: This setting is applied at the role level for compatibility across all environments and connection poolers.

## Breaking Changes üî•

{{< feature-info "Multichannel Projects" "Server" >}}

### Removal of Multi-Channel Projects :fire:

Multi-Channel Configurations within one Project have been completely removed. Projects can no longer contain multiple channels. **Please contact Livingdocs support immediately to plan your migration** to migrate content types into one channel.

Functionality-wise some setups might need to migrate tests to not create multiple channels. There will be errors if some test setup uses multiple channels. If you don't see errors, there's nothing to do.

Data-wise at the moment no data gets deleted in postgres. **But documents of the secondary channel won't be available anymore in any queries**. We'll delete all the data in another release.

### Removal of `server._` in favor of `httpServer._` :fire:

The Livingdocs Server config properties `server._` has been moved to `httpServer._` in `release-2022-09`. In this release we‚Äôve enforced the new config as breaking change.

{{< feature-info "Config" "Server" >}}

### Enforce uniqueness of project config props :fire:

Enforce uniqueness of project config properties `contentTypes[].handle`, `finiteProducts[].issueContentType`, `dashboards[].columns[].handle`, `editorSettings.mainNavigationGroups[].handle`, and `contentTypes[].componentGroups[].name`. Due to miss-configuration, our setup had no effect in certain cases.

`Postgres v13` has been deprecated, as it‚Äôs end of life in November 2025.

{{< feature-info "Server API" "Server" >}}

### Deprecate endpoint `GET /api/:apiVersion/channelConfig` :warning:

The endpoint `GET /api/:apiVersion/channelConfig` is deprecated and `/api/2025-05/channelConfig` is the last api version that supports it.  
Please use `/api/2025-07/projectConfig` instead.

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:

- TBD

No known vulnerabilities. :tada:

### Livingdocs Editor

This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- TBD

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

- [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
- [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Patches

Here is a list of all patches after the release has been announced.

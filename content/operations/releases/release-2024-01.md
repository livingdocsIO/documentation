## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

{{< feature-info "Release" "server" >}}
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

No upstream migrations were added this release.

{{< feature-info "Requirements" "server" >}}
### Drop support for Node v18.17 :fire:

Drop support for Node versions below 18.17 due to a dependency. Use `livingdocs/server-base:20` and `livingdocs/editor-base:20` or the latest `livingdocs/server-base:18.x` or `livingdocs/editor-base:18.x` container images: `livingdocs/server-base:18.4` and `livingdocs/editor-base:18.6`.

* [Server: Remove Node <v18.17 support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6363)

{{< feature-info "Project configuration" "server" >}}
### Custom downstream plugins paramSchema validation changes :fire:

Plugins used in other contexts than the ones stated in the [docs](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/), will now report an error during server startup.

All downstream plugins are supported by default in document metadata and media library metadata. But if a downstream plugin is used in include services, creation flows or push messages, that will now cause an error during startup.

If a downstream plugin is being used in an include service or a creation flow params schema the following configuration needs to be added to the plugin declaration:

```js
supportedPluginContexts: [
  'documentMetadata',
  'mediaLibraryEntryMetadata',
  'includeParams',
  'creationFlowParams'
]
```

You should remove the `serverConfig.useStrictSchemas` property if you set it in the previous release.

Please contact your Livingdocs customer manager if you have any problems with the limitations imposed by the supported plugin contexts.

* [Server PR: Validate plugin configuration in various contexts](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6205)

{{< feature-info "Server configuration" "server" >}}
### Config option `realtimeUpdates.enabled` :fire:

The option `serverConfig.documents.realtimeUpdates.enabled` has been removed. 
Please remove the `enabled` property from your Server configuration and replace it with one or both of the following properties instead:
  - `serverConfig.documents.realtimeUpdates.pollingEnabled`
  - `serverConfig.documents.realtimeUpdates.websocketsEnabled`

This breaking change concerns the [Teaser includes reload]({{< ref "operations/releases/release-2023-11#teaser-includes-reload" >}}) feature. Please read the feature documentation for more information.

* [Server PR: Remove `enabled` config property from `serverConfig.documents.realtimeUpdates`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6380)

{{< feature-info "li-documents feature" "server" >}}
### Document Patch API :fire:

Document patch API `document.patch` support has been removed. Please replace it with `documentApi.executeDocumentCommands`. No data migration is required, but you will need to swap `patches` parameter with `commands`, and `user` with `userId`.

* [Server PR: Remove document patch endpoint and method](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6378)

{{< feature-info "Editing api" "server" >}}
### Endpoint `PATCH /documents/:id` :fire:

This concerns an internal API used by the Livingdocs Editor which has been used
in the past by customizations.

The Endpoint `PATCH /documents/:id` support has been removed. Please replace it with `PATCH /documents/:id/commands`. No data migration is required, but you will need to swap `patches` parameter with `commands`.

* [Server PR: Remove document patch endpoint and method](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6378)

{{< feature-info "Project configuration" "server" >}}
### Custom Channel config Properties via `uiComponent` property :fire:

Support for custom Channel config Properties via `uiComponent` property has been removed.
Please remove your property registration on the server `liServer.registerChannelConfigProperty()`.
There isn't a replacement for this functionality.

* [Server PR: Remove support for custom Channel config property](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6379)
* [Editor PR: Remove support for custom Channel config property](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7766)

{{< feature-info "Editor UI" "editor" >}}
### Prepare Publish Flow feature :fire:

Support for the Prepare Publish Flow is removed, Publish Control is always used. No action is required.

* [Editor PR: Remove Prepare Publish Flow](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7664)

{{< feature-info "Dashboards" "editor" >}}
### Filter Sets feature :fire:

Filter Sets feature has been removed in favor of configuring multiple dashboards to provide fast access to different sets of documents for different roles.

* [Editor PR: Remove Filter Sets](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7737)

## Deprecations :warning:

{{< feature-info "Project Configuration" "server"  >}}
### `defaultComponents` in container directives :warning:

Container directives can define `defaultComponents`, but the config has only an effect on direct children. With `release-2024-03`, nested containers inherit the `defaultComponents` from parent containers.
Please add explicit `defaultComponents` to containers, if they shall not inherit the `defaultComponents` from parent containers.

## Features

{{< feature-info "Media Library" "editor" >}}
### Media Library UX improvements :gift:

New behavior added to the Media Library. When clicking a thumbnail on the Media Library view, a sidepanel appears with reduced details. The sidepanel allows users to edit metadata properties, but media actions and multi-language edit are not available. This view allows you to quickly inspect the details of a media library entry without leaving the Media Library view.

Hovering over the thumbnail will show the actions:
- Pencil button links to full edit page
- Magnifying glass button opens overlay with large image preview with the possibility to show a reduced set of metadata properties. The supported metadata property types are:
  - li-text
  - li-integer
  - li-boolean
  - li-date
  - li-datetime
  - li-enum
  - li-string-list

{{< feature-info "Public api" "server" >}}
### Event Actors :gift:

`actor` property has been added to the webhook payload. This property reports the actor that triggered the event. The use case can be defining a priority lane to prioritise events triggered by humans over machines or filter events by trigger actor.

The following actors are supported:
  - `user` - user triggered the event, user name is not reported in the webhook payload: `{type: 'user'}`
  - `importer` - import actor triggered the event, actor name is reported in the webhook payload: `{type: 'importer', name: 'importer-name'}`
  - `api-client` - api client triggered the event, actor name is reported in the webhook payload: `{type: 'api-client', name: 'api-client-name'}`

Example webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "document.delete",
  "deliveryId": "Vulsdw3-y2JLqnE13NjPa",
  "projectId": 3,
  "projectHandle": "service",
  "webhookHandle": "test-1",
  "documentId": 123,
  "actor": {
    "type": "importer",
    "name": "Importer"
  }
}
```

{{< feature-info "Server Configuration" "server" >}}
### Secure Opensearch/Kibana :gift:

To improve security in the Livingdocs infrastructure, we have added a new authentication method to the Opensearch/Kibana stack. It is now possible to use AWS credentials methods to access the Opensearch/Kibana. The new configuration can be found in the [Server config withing `search` property]({{< ref "customising/server-configuration#search" >}}):

```js
search: {
  elasticsearchClient: {
    // AWS Credentials support for OpenSearch
    // You can configure any AWS Credentials provider supported by the AWS SDK credentials-provider-node
    // configuration provided: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/credential-provider-node#supported-configuration
    // Please make sure to always define aws object, even if you don't use AWS credentials 
    aws: {
      accessKeyId: '*****',
      secretAccessKey: '*****',
      region: 'eu-central-1'
    }
  }
}
```

For production environments:
- using AWS IAM Roles you can define a token with `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` in the `aws` object
- when running the Livingdocs Server in EKS, use the [IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) feature to assign the required permissions to the Livingdocs Server pod.
- when running the Livingdocs Server in ECS/Fargate, use the [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) feature to assign the required permissions to the Livingdocs Server task.

For local development, AWS Profile credentials can be used when connecting to remote Opensearch/Kibana. In both cases make sure to define the `region` property.

```js
search: {
  elasticsearchClient: {
    aws: {
      region: 'eu-central-1'
    }
  }
}
```

{{< feature-info "Public api" "server" >}}
### Support `publishControl.visiblePublicationDateOverride` on Import API :gift:

The `publishControl.visiblePublicationDateOverride` property can now be set within the `documents` parameter when [importing articles via the Import API]({{< ref "reference/public-api/imports/documents#import-documents" >}}). This allows you to set the visible publication date override when importing documents. As with other publish related properties, `"flags": {"autoPublish": true}` must be defined when using the Public API.

{{< feature-info "Webhooks" "server" >}}
### Add support for 'document.create' and 'document.delete' webhooks :gift:

New webhooks for document create and delete have been added to the [webhooks list]({{< ref "reference/webhooks#list-of-available-webhook-events" >}}). These webhooks are triggered when a document is created or deleted. Please find webhook payload examples below:

```json
{
  "event": "document.create",
  "deliveryId": "KIOSZpPUt8X6X-FDlnLTX",
  "projectId": 3,
  "projectHandle": "service",
  "webhookHandle": "test-1",
  "documentId": 123,
  "actor": {
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "event": "document.delete",
  "deliveryId": "Vulsdw3-y2JLqnE13NjPa",
  "projectId": 3,
  "projectHandle": "service",
  "webhookHandle": "test-1",
  "documentId": 123,
  "actor": {
    "type": "api-client",
    "name": "Publibot 3000"
  }
}
```

{{< feature-info "Media Library Search" "editor" >}}
### Sort options of DisplayFilters are respected in Media Library :gift:

The Media Library DisplayFilter respects sorting options. This adapts the behavior of the Table Dashboards. The sorting options are defined in the [DisplayFilter configuration]({{< ref "guides/editor/custom-dashboard-filters/index" >}}).

This feature has also been backported to `release-2023-11` and `release-2023-09`.

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server" >}}
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

{{< feature-info "Project config" "server" >}}
### Custom downstream plugins paramSchema validation changes :fire:

Plugins used in other contexts than the ones stated in the [docs](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/plugins/), will now report an error during server startup.

All downstream plugins are supported by default in document metadata and media library metadata. But if a downstream plugin is used in include services, creation flows or push messages, that will now cause an error during startup.

If a downstream plugin is being used in an include service params schema the following configuration needs to be added to the plugin declaration:

```
supportedPluginContexts: [
  'documentMetadata',
  'mediaLibraryEntryMetadata',
  'includeParams'
]
```

You should remove the `serverConfig.useStrictSchemas` property if you set it in the previous release.

Please contact your Livingdocs customer manager if you have any problems with the limitations imposed by the supported plugin contexts.

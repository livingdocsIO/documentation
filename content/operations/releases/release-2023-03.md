The Estimated Time of Completion Metadata Plugin `li-estimated-time-of-completion` enables a user to set an estimated time of completion for the current document. The plugin is available in the Metadata Form.

**Notice**: The li-estimated-time-of-completion plugin is only available if the Planning System is enabled.

* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6255)
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5176)

#### Team Plugin

The team Metadata Plugin `li-team` enables a user to associate other users with the current document by adding or removing them from the teams plugin. Additionally one user can be marked as the owner. The owner can not be removed from the team.
The plugin is available in the Metadata Form and the Table Dashboard.

**Notice**: The li-team plugin is only available if the Planning System is enabled.

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-team" >}})
* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6024)
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4974)

#### Task List Table Dashboard Cell

The Task List Table Dashboard Cell `liTableDashboardCellTaskList` is a read only component for the Table Dashboard. It gives an overview of current tasks connected with the given document.

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#litabledashboardcelltasklist" >}})
* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6325)
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5230)

### API Consumer Management

With the new API Consumer Management feature you are now able to manage the lifecycle for tokens, e.g.
- manage token rotation
- manage token suspension
- manage token expiration

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/get-started#authorization" >}})

* [PR Server: API Consumer Management](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5170)

## Notable Features

### Retresco Queued Retagging

A new hook is introduced to the Retresco integration. It allows document re-enrich functionality with Retresco tags in a queued manner. This is useful if you want to re-enrich a large number of documents in a batch.

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/guides/integrations/retresco#re-enrich-documents" >}})
* [PR Server: Retresco retagging hook](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5254)

### Metadata Property Display Filters

A new type of [Display Filters]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter" >}}) is introduced: `metadataPropertyName`.

With these filters, you will be able to easily configure a filter for any metadata property on your documents. Currently, only 2 types of metadata properties are supported: `li-integer` and `li-category`. Support for other types will be added in future releases.

### link rel="sponsored"

You can now add `rel="sponsored"` tag to an HTML link in the text formatting toolbar. This is useful if you want to mark links as sponsored for search engines.

* [PR Editor: rel='sponsored' can be added to a HTML link in Text Formatting Toolbar](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6245)

### Anonymize User History

You can now configure timespan in the server configuration after which the revision history will be anonymized.
After said time, the editor does not receive a `user_id` with the revisions response and thus can not render the associated users but renders a fallback "Anonymous User".

* [Documentation]({{< ref "/customising/server-configuration#documents" >}})
* [PR Editor: Anonymized History after specified time](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6284)
* [PR Server: Anonymized History after specified time](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5191)

## Small Improvements

### Publish Control Import API Support

You can now set `publishControl.firstPublicationDate` and `publishControl.lastPublicationDate` when importing documents using the Import API.
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5253)

## Breaking Changes :fire:
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 186-api-clients.js
#   adds new table for API Clients and API Tokens
# migration 193-increase-document-title-length.js
#   increases the length of the document title to 1000 characters
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Upgrade cheerio to 1.0.0-rc.12 :fire:

This change only affects customers using a customized render pipeline or the hugo feature and if you have `cheerio` in your package.json.

- `cheerio.load` behaves slightly different and automatically appends '<html><body>' tags. Please follow the upgrade instruction from cheerio https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio#loading.
- Newlines `\r\n` now get normalized to `\n`.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5063)


### Drop Imagemagick support :fire:

The usage of it was discouraged since a long time because of security issues.
Remove the server config property `mediaLibrary.images.processingStrategy`.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5095)


### Do not support running the core tests in a downstream editor :fire:

:fire: Remove testing core editor tests from a downstream with `npm explore @livingdocs/editor -- npm test`
:fire: If you copied the testing setup of Livingdocs, you have to add `"angular-mocks": "^1.8.3"` in your `devDependencies`.

Another recommended cleanup step is to move all `chai`, `mocha`, `karma` and `sinon` packages from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`


### Remove Dashboard Display Filters :fire:

These Dashboard Display Filters are not supported anymore:
- `coreApi.searchFilters.register`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerList`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerAngularComponent`

Update the deprecated filter to the supported [Display Filters](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter/) from the core.
- Named Filters
- Metadata Filters
- ListV2 Filters

If you can't handle your requirements with core filters it's best to contact your Customer Solutions manager to get inputs for solutions (one option is to create your custom Vue component, but that should be prevented whenever possible).

References:
* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6166)
* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6136)

### Remove Editor Config appConfig.app.sidePanelItems :fire:

The Editor Config `appConfig.app.sidePanelItems` is removed, move the config to the Project Config `editorSettings.mainNavigation`.

References:
* [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)

### Document Revision Creation

Previously we created a new revision for document updates when any of the following conditions were true:
- First change after publication
- User did not make the previous change
- Revision is over 15 minutes old
- Revision has not been updated for over 2 minutes

:fire: The rules above still apply, but only when revision data has changed. Changes to `Document Title`, `System Metadata`and `Publish Control` data will not create a new revision.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5231)







## Deprecations

### Deprecate appConfig.ui.welcome

The editor config `appConfig.ui.welcome` is deprecated and will be removed in `release-2023-03`.
- Option 1: Configure your welcome screen in the Project Config via [startPage]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#startpage" >}})
- Option 2: Switch to a [Home Screen]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#home-screen" >}})

Breaking Change: `release-2023-03`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)


### Deprecate Display Filter config for category

The Display Filter of a metadata property of type `li-category` should be reconfigured as `{metadataPropertyName: 'category'}`

Breaking Change: not defined yet

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6136)


### Public API - Project Endpoints

- Deprecate `/api/v1/project` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead
- Deprecate `/api/v1/channels` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead
- Deprecate `/api/v1/channels/:channelHandle` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead

Breaking Change: `release-2023-11`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5178)






## APIs :gift:

### Import API - Payload

:gift: Make `content` and `metadata` optional in payload -> easier to handle `Data Records` with that.
Pass `content` and `design` on the top level of a document payload instead in a livingdoc

```js
{
  "systemName": "identifier-for-your-system",
  ...
  "documents": [
    {
      "title": "test import",
      ...
      // before, deprecated
      "livingdoc": {
        "content": [ ... ],
        "design": {
          "name": "living-times",
          "version": "1.0.1"
        }
      },
      // now
      "content": [ ... ],
      "design": {
        "name": "living-times",
        "version": "1.0.1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

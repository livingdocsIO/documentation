### Metadata Property Display Filters

A new type of [Display Filters]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter" >}})) is introduced: `metadataPropertyName`.

With these filters, you will be able to easily configure a filter for any metadata property on your documents. Currently, only 2 types of metadata properties are supported: `li-integer` and `li-category`. Support for other types will be added in future releases.

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Upgrade cheerio to 1.0.0-rc.12 :fire:

This change only affects customers using a customized render pipeline or the hugo feature and if you have `cheerio` in your package.json.

- `cheerio.load` behaves slightly different and automatically appends '<html><body>' tags. Please follow the upgrade instruction from cheerio https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio#loading.
- Newlines `\r\n` now get normalized to `\n`.

* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5063)


### Drop Imagemagick support :fire:

The usage of it was discouraged since a long time because of security issues.
Remove the server config property `mediaLibrary.images.processingStrategy`.

References:
* [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5095)


### Do not support running the core tests in a downstream editor :fire:

:fire: Remove testing core editor tests from a downstream with `npm explore @livingdocs/editor -- npm test`
:fire: If you copied the testing setup of Livingdocs, you have to add `"angular-mocks": "^1.8.3"` in your `devDependencies`.

Another recommended cleanup step is to move all `chai`, `mocha`, `karma` and `sinon` packages from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`


### Remove Dashboard Display Filters :fire:

These Dashboard Display Filters are not supported anymore:
- `coreApi.searchFilters.register`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerList`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerAngularComponent`

Update the deprecated filter to the supported [Display Filters](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter/) from the core.
- Named Filters
- Metadata Filters
- ListV2 Filters

If you can't handle your requirements with core filters it's best to contact your Customer Solutions manager to get inputs for solutions (one option is to create your custom Vue component, but that should be prevented whenever possible).

- [PR Server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6166)
- [PR Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6136)

### Remove Editor Config appConfig.app.sidePanelItems :fire:

The Editor Config `appConfig.app.sidePanelItems` is removed, move the config to the Project Config `editorSettings.mainNavigation`.

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)

### Document Revision Creation

Previously we created a new revision for document updates when any of the following conditions were true:
- First change after publication
- User did not make the previous change
- Revision is over 15 minutes old
- Revision has not been updated for over 2 minutes

:fire: The rules above still apply, but only when revision data has changed. Changes to `Document Title`, `System Metadata`and `Publish Control` data will not create a new revision.

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5231)







## Deprecations

### Deprecate appConfig.ui.welcome

The editor config `appConfig.ui.welcome` is deprecated and will be removed in `release-2023-03`.
- Option 1: Configure your welcome screen in the Project Config via [startPage]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#startpage" >}})
- Option 2: Switch to a [Home Screen]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#home-screen" >}})

Breaking Change: `release-2023-03`

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6153)


### Deprecate Display Filter config for category

The Display Filter of a metadata property of type `li-category` should be reconfigured as `{metadataPropertyName: 'category'}`

Breaking Change: not defined yet

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6136)


### Public API - Project Endpoints

- Deprecate `/api/v1/project` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead
- Deprecate `/api/v1/channels` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead
- Deprecate `/api/v1/channels/:channelHandle` -> use `/api/v1/projectConfig` instead

Breaking Change: `release-2023-11`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5178)






## APIs :gift:

### Import API - Payload

:gift: Make `content` and `metadata` optional in payload -> easier to handle `Data Records` with that.
Pass `content` and `design` on the top level of a document payload instead in a livingdoc

```js
{
  "systemName": "identifier-for-your-system",
  ...
  "documents": [
    {
      "title": "test import",
      ...
      // before, deprecated
      "livingdoc": {
        "content": [ ... ],
        "design": {
          "name": "living-times",
          "version": "1.0.1"
        }
      },
      // now
      "content": [ ... ],
      "design": {
        "name": "living-times",
        "version": "1.0.1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

TODO: add db migrations

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop support for node 14

ðŸ”¥ Drop support for node 14, use node v18 instead.

### Upgrade to elasticsearch client v8

ðŸ”¥ The response structure changed in the new client. If you have custom code that accesses elasticsearch, you'll need to update it accordingly:

```diff
- const {body} = await elasticsearchClient.search({
+ const body = await elasticsearchClient.search({
    index: 'li-documents',
    q: `document.id:${this.doc.id}`
  })
```

Please see the examples of elasticsearch how to use it: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/get_examples.html


ðŸ”¥ The elasticsearch client configuration changed slightly. Please consult the elasticsearch client configuration documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/basic-config.html

```diff
  search: {
    elasticsearchClient: {
      node: 'https://127.0.0.1:9200/',
      auth: {username: 'admin', password: 'admin'},
-     ssl: {rejectUnauthorized: false}
+     tls: {rejectUnauthorized: false}
    }
  },
```

### Remove metadata plugin li-media-language

ðŸ”¥ Remove metadata plugin `li-media-language`, use `li-metadata-translations` instead.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4899)


### Remove deprecated document.path

Since a long time we deprecated the DB property `documents.path`, because there is no real feature behind that property.

:fire: `contentTypes[].editor.deliveryLinks` do not support`:path` placeholder
:fire: editor model `draft.path` is not accessible anymore

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5001)


### Support removal of metadata properties by assigning null

ðŸ”¥ Before this change, assigning null values resulted in a metadata schema error.
Now it's accepted and it removes the metadata property. Therefore it's not possible anymore to save the value null as metadata property value.

```js
// before
metadata.myField = null // throws
// now
metadata.myField = null // delete metadata.myField
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5007)

### Mandatory project_id in documentApi.find

ðŸ”¥ Make `project_id` mandatory in `documentApi.find`

### Fix firstPublicationDate to documents table (Post Deployment) :fire:

This script was backported to release-2022-11, so it has been added again for release-2023-01 in case anyone missed it. If you already ran the script with the previous release upgrade you do not need to run it again.

If you have unpublished a document while running release-2022-07 or release-2022-09 then you may have inaccurate values for the `document.systemdata.firstPublicationDate`. Below is a comparison of the change in the four most recent versions:

First publish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Set `firstPublicationDate`

Republish while published:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Keep `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Remove `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Republish after unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Essentially the old behaviour and the new "fixed" behaviour is to set `firstPublicationDate` once and never modify it. This property will still exist even when the document is unpublished. For release-2022-07 and release-2022-09 the difference in behaviour was that the `firstPublicationDate` would be cleared on unpublish and set again at the next publish.

If you would like to correct the `firstPublicationDate` property for all of your articles you can run:
```bash
node ./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/009-fix-first-publication-date.js
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Check that `first_publication_id` has been set (same as the script 007-populate-first-publication-data.js)
2. Move `firstPublicationDate` from `data` to `data.publishControl`
3. Remove `data.firstPublicationDate`
4. If `firstPublicationDate` is not set then use the value from the first publication
5. If `firstPublicationDate` is set then use the value from the first publication when the first publication is older

It is highly recommended that you run this script because it is performing a data migration as well as fixing the values.

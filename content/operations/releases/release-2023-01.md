* [PR: Editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6082)

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 184-increase-webhook-handle-length.js
#   limit webhook handle to 50 characters
# migration 185-li-get-leaf-of-revision-history.js
#   add psql function li_get_leaf_of_revision_history
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop support for node v14

ðŸ”¥ Drop support for node 14, use node v18 instead.

### Drop support for Redis < v6.2

ðŸ”¥ The minimal required Redis version is v6.2.

### Upgrade to elasticsearch client v8

ðŸ”¥ The response structure changed in the new client. If you have custom code that accesses elasticsearch, you'll need to update it accordingly:

```diff
- const {body} = await elasticsearchClient.search({
+ const body = await elasticsearchClient.search({
    index: 'li-documents',
    q: `document.id:${this.doc.id}`
  })
```

Please see the examples of elasticsearch how to use it: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/get_examples.html


ðŸ”¥ The elasticsearch client configuration changed slightly. Please consult the elasticsearch client configuration documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/basic-config.html

```diff
  search: {
    elasticsearchClient: {
      node: 'https://127.0.0.1:9200/',
      auth: {username: 'admin', password: 'admin'},
-     ssl: {rejectUnauthorized: false}
+     tls: {rejectUnauthorized: false}
    }
  },
```

### Stricter search queries

- ðŸ”¥ Filters on unavailable properties throw an error.
- ðŸ”¥ Elasticsearch `exists` queries on objects not supported anymore. Please use a specific sub-property instead.

   e.g. To filter for documents that have no category assigned, you need to use `category.reference.id` instead of `category` in the editor search filter:
  ```diff
  {
    id: 'without-category',
    label: 'Without category',
    type: 'metadata',
  -  key: 'category',
  +  key: 'category.reference.id',
    value: {exists: false}
  }
  ```

### Don't expose error_details in 5xx response

ðŸ”¥ 5XX responses will no longer contain `body.error_details` object, still the whole error response will be logged.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4988)

### Remove metadata plugin li-media-language

ðŸ”¥ Remove metadata plugin `li-media-language`, use `li-metadata-translations` instead.

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4899)


### Remove deprecated document.path

Since a long time we deprecated the DB property `documents.path`, because there is no real feature behind that property.

:fire: `contentTypes[].editor.deliveryLinks` do not support`:path` placeholder
:fire: editor model `draft.path` is not accessible anymore

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5001)


### Support removal of metadata properties by assigning null

ðŸ”¥ Before this change, assigning null values resulted in a metadata schema error.
Now it's accepted and it removes the metadata property. Therefore it's not possible anymore to save the value null as metadata property value.

```js
// before
metadata.myField = null // throws
// now
metadata.myField = null // delete metadata.myField
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5007)

### Mandatory project_id in documentApi.find

ðŸ”¥ Make `project_id` mandatory in `documentApi.find`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5017)

### Fix firstPublicationDate to documents table (Post Deployment) :fire:

This script was backported to release-2022-11, so it has been added again for release-2023-01 in case anyone missed it. If you already ran the script with the previous release upgrade you do not need to run it again.

If you have unpublished a document while running release-2022-07 or release-2022-09 then you may have inaccurate values for the `document.systemdata.firstPublicationDate`. Below is a comparison of the change in the four most recent versions:

First publish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Set `firstPublicationDate`

Republish while published:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Keep `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Remove `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Republish after unpublish:
release-2022-07 and release-2022-09: Set `firstPublicationDate`
release-2022-05 and release-2022-11: Keep `firstPublicationDate`

Essentially the old behaviour and the new "fixed" behaviour is to set `firstPublicationDate` once and never modify it. This property will still exist even when the document is unpublished. For release-2022-07 and release-2022-09 the difference in behaviour was that the `firstPublicationDate` would be cleared on unpublish and set again at the next publish.

If you would like to correct the `firstPublicationDate` property for all of your articles you can run:
```bash
node ./node_modules/@livingdocs/server/db/manual-migrations/009-fix-first-publication-date.js
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Check that `first_publication_id` has been set (same as the script 007-populate-first-publication-data.js)
2. Move `firstPublicationDate` from `data` to `data.publishControl`
3. Remove `data.firstPublicationDate`
4. If `firstPublicationDate` is not set then use the value from the first publication
5. If `firstPublicationDate` is set then use the value from the first publication when the first publication is older

It is highly recommended that you run this script because it is performing a data migration as well as fixing the values.

## Deprecations

### Deprecate Dashboard Display Filters

These Dashboard Display Filters get deprecated:
- `coreApi.searchFilters.register`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerList`
- `coreApi.searchFilters.registerAngularComponent`

Update the deprecated filter to the supported [Display Filters](https://docs.livingdocs.io/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter/) from the core.
- Named Filters
- Metadata Filters
- ListV2 Filters

If you can't handle your requirements with core filters it's best to contact your Customer Solutions manager to get inputs for solutions (one option is to create your custom Vue component, but that should be prevented whenever possible)

Breaking Change: `release-2023-03`

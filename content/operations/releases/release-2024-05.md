## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes 🔥

### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

TODO: check migration

### Assistants :gift:

We are happy to announce the first version of the Livingdocs Assistants Platform.
Use it to understand the system and start learning, what can be done.

Livingdocs Assistants are designed to understand the user's context, namely the current document and focused components.
Assistants can generate an array of [Document Commands]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/document-command-api" >}}) that are then executed server-side.
This feature allows for complex document manipulations through a simplified interface,
initiated from the editor UI using the `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) shortcut,
where users can find and execute available Assistants.

A guide how to implement an assistant can be found [here]({{< ref "/guides/editor/assistants" >}}).

Please share your ideas for assistants with us, we would love to learn and gather more perspectives.

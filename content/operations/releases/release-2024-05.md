## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to the main branch).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes üî•

{{< feature-info "Operations" "server" >}}
### Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 198-assistants.js
#   creates assistant table and support function
# migration 199-remove-tag-suggestions.js
#   removes tag_suggestions table from the database
# migration 200-assistants-unique=constraint.js
#   adds unique constraint to the assistant table
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

{{< feature-info "Integrations" "server/editor" >}}
### Remove iMatrics tag suggestion support :fire:

The tag suggestion feature has been removed from the Livingdocs Editor and Server. Customers can find the functionality over at iMatrics website where they have introduced their own interface for managing tag suggestions.

#### Required Actions

##### Database Migration

Customers should apply the new database migration by running `li-server migrate up`. This drops the `tag_suggestions` table.

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Warning:** All data within this table will be irreversibly deleted. Customers must ensure that any open suggestions are migrated to iMatrics' new suggestion management system. To determine that there are no pending suggestions, they should open the Livingdocs editor at `/<project>/tags/imatrics` and verify that there are no pending suggestions visible. Alternatively, they can also execute the following database query and confirm that it returns no results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tag_suggestions WHERE status LIKE 'open';
```

In case there are pending suggestions, customers should either accept or reject them within our interface, provided they are using an older release. Alternatively, they can refer to the iMatrics API documentation on how to programmatically insert them into the new suggestion system.

##### Menu Item

Customers should remove menu items `{liItem: 'tags'}` from their project configurations.

##### iMatrics Webportal

Customers should verify that _Concept Management and Concept Suggestions_ is enabled in their iMatrics account. If this is not the case, they should reach out to iMatrics to have it enabled.

* [Server PR: Replace iMatrics suggestion management](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/6774)

{{< feature-info "liServer" "server" >}}
### Remove internal arrays `liServer.onShutdownHandlers` and `liServer.initializedHooks` :fire:

The internal arrays `liServer.onShutdownHandlers` and `liServer.initializedHooks` have been removed. Other existing hooks can be used to achieve the same functionality.

## Deprecations

{{< feature-info "Server Configuration" "server" >}}
### `appConfig.textcount` configuration :warning:

`appConfig.textcount` configuration has been moved to `projectConfig.editorSettings.textCount`. The `appConfig.textcount` configuration will be removed in `release-2024-11`.

Please migrate text count config from `appConfig.textcount` to `projectConfig.editorSettings.textCount`.
```js
editorSettings: {
  ...
  textCount: {
    isEnabled: true,
    timeout: 200,
    showEditableCount: true,
    lineCountFraction: 39.5 // Added in release-2024-05
  }
}
```

{{< feature-info "Desk-net API" "server" >}}
### Desk-net API function parameters :warning:

- Instead of `createFromDesknet(projectId, element)` please use `createFromDesknet({projectId, userId, element})`. `userId` is a new required property.
- Instead of `updateFromDesknet(projectId, documentId, element, opts)` please use `updateFromDesknet({projectId, documentId, userId, element, linkPublication})`. `userId` is a new required property.
- Instead of `unlinkFromDesknet(projectId, documentId)` please use `unlinkFromDesknet({projectId, documentId, userId})`. `userId` is a new required property.

{{< feature-info "Dashboards" "server" >}}
### Dashboards of type `dashboard` :warning:

{{< feature-info "Dashboards" "server" >}}
### Angular custom dashboard cards :warning:


## Features

{{< feature-info "Assistants" "server" >}}
### Livingdocs Assistants

#### Register an assistant

```js
  liServer.registerAssistant({
    projectHandles: ['example'], // skip to register it for all projects
    handle: 'generateTitle',
    label: 'Generate Title',
    description: 'Generate an article title',
    iconUrl: 'https://livingdocsio.github.io/livingdocs-design-assets/docs/icons/component-icons/header_simple.svg',
    async assist ({context}) {
      const {document, projectConfig} = context
      const projectHandle = projectConfig.key.projectHandle
      const contentType = document.contentType

      // Apply context validations before executing the command
      if (projectHandle !== 'service' && contentType !== 'article') {
        throw validationError(
          'Cool Title assistant is only available on articles in example project'
        )
      }
      if (!document) {
        throw validationError('Generate Title assistant requires a document')
      }

      const oldTitle = document.metadata.title
      const newTitle = await aiService.generateTitle(document.content)

      // Use Command API compatible commands to modify a document.
      // Return undefined if not applicable.
      return {
        commands: [
          {
            operation: 'setMetadataProperty',
            propertyName: 'title',
            value: newTitle,
            oldValue: oldTitle
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

Possible properties on `context`:
- `projectConfig`
- `documentId` (optional)
- `document` (optional)
- `focusedComponentId` (optional)

Commands are executed with an assistant actor (one per project/assistant combination).
Actors are created on demand.

  config: {index: true}
}

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2024-28863](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36) patched in `tar` v6.2.1

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-44270](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j) vulnerability in `postcss`, it affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is not exploitable in the editor as we don't load untrusted external CSS at build time.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

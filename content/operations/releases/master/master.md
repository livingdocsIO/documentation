## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the database :fire:

TODO: update migration section

- Expected duration?
- Possible data losses?
- Is it a simple migration? (fast/easy downgradable)

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database scheme
# migration - 111-add-comments-table.js
#   create comments table + add events to the stream_events_types table
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Migrate knex transactions to pg :fire:

💣  The knex instance on `liServer.db.connection` is deprecated
:fire: Knex transactions aren't compatible with livingdocs anymore. Please use `db.begin` instead:

```js
const db = liServer.db
liServer.db.begin(async (trx) => {
  db.sql`UPDATE something set foo = 'bar'`.transacting(trx)
  // or
  await trx.sql`UPDATE something set foo = 'bar'`
})
```

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4163)

### Remove columns from documents / document_publication_events table :fire:

💣 Remove `metadata_id`, `channel_id`, `content_type` and `document_type` columns from the `documents` table
💣 Remove `channel_id`, `content_type` and `document_type` columns from the `document_publication_events` table

Those changes shouldn't affect any downstream, but in case there are direct sql queries against the database, you need to switch to queries that use the `content_type_id` column.

References: [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4165)

### publishHook / unpublishHook parameter change :fire:

:fire: Change the parameters in `publishHook` and `unpublishHook`.
- `params.payload.documentVersion` moved to `params.documentVersion`. This `documentVersion` doesn't run through the render pipeline anymore. Please use `params.render()` to get the old behavior if you need to.
- `params.payload.renditions` got removed. Please use `params.render()` or the rendition api directly if you need to create a rendition. The usage of this function is discouraged as the publish hook gets executed within a transaction and it will degrade the performance and can cause deadlocks.
- Access of `params.payload` now throws an error
- `document.publish` event doesn't receive the renditions anymore
- `document.publish` event now receives the raw `documentVersion`, where `metadataPlugin.onRender` wasn't called.

**Migration example**
```js
async publishHookAsync (params) {
  // params.payload.documentVersion moved to params.documentVersion
  await doSomething(params.documentVersion)

  // params.payload.renditions got removed.
  // The render-pipeline doesn't get called anymore.
  // You can still call it explicitly, but that's discouraged
  // as the publishHook is executed within a transaction
  // and expensive operations will reduce the performance and can cause deadlocks:
  const {documentVersion, renditions} = await params.render()
  await pushRenditionsToExternalService(renditions)
}
```

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4123)

### Document Inbox - remove position parameter :fire:

The `position` parameter can no longer be passed to `server.features.api('li-document-inbox').removeItem({})` or `POST /documents/:documentId/inbox-remove`

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4081)

### Remove support for callbacks in projectApi :fire:

We removed Callback support in several server API's as we noticed many bugs originating from mixing callbacks and promises. So we continue to phase out callbacks in all APIs. In the next releases we will continue with the removal of callbacks in server API's. All server API's already support Promises, therefore you can prepare the downstream migration from Callbacks to Promises.

- 🔥 remove callback support for projectApi (`server.features.api('li-projects')`) functions. Only promise based calls are supported

You can find migration a migration example [here]({{< ref "/content/operations/releases/release-2021-09/release-2021-09.md#example-how-to-migrate" >}}).

References: [projectApi PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4160)

### Button group improvement :fire:

If you have any custom UI in your downstream that makes use of any of the following you want to read this:

No longer existing classes:
- `.ld-btn-group`, `.ld-btn-group__item`, `.ld-btn-group__item-v2`, `.ld-btn-group--right`, `.ld-btn-group--full`, `.ld-btn-group--toggle`, `.ld-btn-group--arrow`, `.ld-btn-group--cardchange`, `.ld-btn-group--selection`, `.ld-btn-group--center`, `.ld-btn-group--extension`

You are highly encouraged to refactor your markup / custom stylesheets to not use these things anymore. In order to ease that process, there is a file you can `@import` in your custom SCSS to get support for the mentioned classes and variables:
In the SCSS file you have configured as `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE` or `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER` add this line at the top:
```sass
@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2022-02.scss";
```
This will define the removed classes within your SCSS file tree. Your custom UI will most probably look just fine. From there on you can refactor your code and remove the `@import "~styles/backwards-compatibiliy/release-2022-02.scss";` after you are done. We will keep this file around for some time, but it will eventually get removed. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to contact us.

**Required Actions for Refactoring**
In case you're making use of the above mentioned classes in your downstream:
- Replace any .li-btn-group or .li-button-group element with the new `<li-button-group>` Vue or Angular components
- Buttons should be placed directly within the component
- See the **style guide screenshot below** for examples

## Deprecations

### Postgres

Postgres 11 is now deprecated. Please update to Postgres 14.1 whenever possible.

### Configuration `auth.accessTokenSecret`

The configuration `auth.accessTokenSecret` gets replaced by `auth.accessTokenSigningKeys`.
Old configurations are still valid, but make sure you'll convert your secret to a JSON web key as soon as you use the new configuration property.

```diff
  auth: {
-    accessTokenSecret: "some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing"
      // Generate the JSON web key using
      //   $ livingdocs-server key-generate convert-hs256 'some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing'
+    accessTokenSigningKeys: [{"kty":"oct","k":"c29tZS1zZWNyZXQtZm9yLWhtYWMyNTYtdG9rZW4tc2lnbmluZw","kid":"","alg":"HS256","use":"sig"}]
}
```

Take the existing `auth.accessTokenSecret` value and convert it to a JSON web key.
To ease the conversion, we have the following command that outputs the json
for the `auth.accessTokenSigningKeys` array:

```bash
livingdocs-server key-generate convert-hs256 'some-secret-for-hmac256-token-signing'
```

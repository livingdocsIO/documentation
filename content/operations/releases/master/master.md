## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Breaking Changes :fire:

### Migrate the database :fire:

TODO: update migrations

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop Postgres 10 support :fire:

üî• Drop Postgres 10 support

* [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4541)

### Remove Component Library and ContentType config UI :fire:

:fire: The possibility to view edit components and content-types and their metadata is removed from the Project Config UI in the editor.
This feature hasn't been used by customers in production for a while, and it was badly maintained. We want to invest more into the CLI instead.

References:
- [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5342)

### Remove Several Server Configs :fire:

* üî• remove deprecated `serverConfig.levelUpAdpater`, use `serverConfig.kv.levelUpAdapter` instead
* üî• remove deprecated `serverConfig.levelDbAdapter`, use `serverConfig.kv.levelUpAdapter` instead
* üî• remove deprecated `serverConfig.db`, use `serverConfig.kv.levelUpAdapter` instead
  * ‚ÑπÔ∏è Only `serverConfig.kv.levelUpAdapter` has an effect on the routing feature.
* üî• remove deprecated `serverConfig.search.imageDocumentIndex`, `use serverConfig.search.mediaLibraryIndex` instead

References:
- [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4455)

### Change DB config preference :fire:

üî• Change db preference of server config - `db.*` configs override `db.connectionString` values

References:
- [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4457)

### Remove option to use comyan images in media library :fire:

Initially, we implemented the option to have a media library entry that points to an external comyan image without uploading the image in Livingdocs. Since no customers is using this and we don't want to use the media library this way, we remove the option.

:fire: The Project Config flag `settings.integrations.comyan.uploadImagesFromComyan` has been removed. If you have this set to `true` you can just remove it, no change in behavior will result. If you have this set to `false` please contact us as the option is not supported anymore.

References:
- [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4562)

### Remove Deprecated Incoming References from public API (beta endpoints) :fire:

üî• Remove `incoming*References` endpoints that have moved to `/api/v1/*` from `/api/beta/*`.

- üî• Remove beta endpoint `/api/beta/documents/:documentID/incomingDocumentReferences`

- üî• Remove beta endpoint `/api/beta/mediaLibrary/:mediaId/incomingDocumentReferences`
- üî• Remove beta endpoint `/api/beta/mediaLibrary/:mediaId/incomingMediaReferences`

- [PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4544)

### Remove deprecated publicationApi functions :fire:

- :fire: Remove `publicationApi.getLatestPublications`.
  Please migrate to `publicationApi.getLatestPublicationsV2`.
    Here's the exact implementation of the old logic using the new function:
    ```js
    async function getLatestPublications ({
      offset, limit,
      project_id, // eslint-disable-line
      projectId = project_id,
      channelId
    }) {
      if (limit > 100) {
        throw validationError('getLatestPublications: maximum limit is 100')
      }

      const documentVersions = await publicationApi.getLatestPublicationsV2({
        projectId,
        channelId,
        offset,
        limit: limit || 100,
        sort: ['publishedAt', 'desc']
      })

      return {documentVersions}
    }
    ```
- :fire: Remove `publicationApi.getPublicationsByDate`.
  Please migrate to `publicationApi.getLatestPublicationsV2`.

  Here's the exact implementation of the old logic using the new function:
  ```js
  function getPublicationsByDate ({projectId, createdAt, limit, offset}) {
    if (!projectId) throw validationError(`The parameter projectId is required.`)

    return publicationApi.getLatestPublicationsV2({
      projectId,
      limit,
      offset,
      documentType: 'article',
      publishedAt: createdAt,
      sort: ['publishedAt', 'desc']
    })
  }
  ```

### Metadata Plugins: Add configSchema and uiSchema Validation :fire:

We added 2 properties `configSchema` and `uiSchema` to a metadata plugin where one can define a schema validation. If you want to know more about the motivation and a fallback (`metadataPluginsToIgnoreForConfigValidation`), you get some insights [here](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4296).

References:
- [Metadata Plugin List Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-docs/document/metadata/metadata-plugin-list)
- [li-integer PR](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-docs/document/metadata/metadata-plugin-list/#li-integer)

### Error on Metadata Plugin registration :fire:

üî• When registering a metadata plugin twice, you get now an error message (before, the second plugin was ignored, which lead to confusion).

References:
- [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4483)

### Remove Core Plugin Whitelist :fire:

üî• Server config `documents.metadata.corePluginWhitelist` removed. Core metadata plugins can not be whitelisted anymore. All plugins are loaded.

References:
- [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/4484)

### Design Class Updates :fire:

:fire: renamed `.ld-switch` to `.li-switch`
:fire: The <input> element no longer requires the class `ld-switch__toggle`

Should you have any switch buttons in your downstream, update your markup according to the changes mentioned above.

References:
- [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/5324)

### Design Cleaning :fire:

After removing the whole Project Setup from Livingdocs some cleaning was necessary. No longer needed CSS had to go. At the same time some underused or generally unused CSS also was removed.

**The following CSS classes have been deleted:**
`.api-client-item__name`, `.api-client-item__scopes`, `.ld-application-menu__button`, `.ld-article-panel--alternative-bg`, `.ld-article-panel--styleguide`, `.ld-burst--half`, `.ld-burst--slim`, `.ld-burst--negative-sides`, `.ld-comp-crumbs` and BEM children, `.ld-component-list--thirds`, `.ld-component-list--halves`, `.ld-component-list__action--hover`, `.ld-component-list__item--highlight`, `.ld-component-list__item--new`, `.service-turned-off`, `.ld-document-filter`, `.ld-drop-zone` and BEM children, `.ld-legend`, `.ld-metadata-panel` and modifiers as well as BEM children, `.ld-navigation`, `.ld-panel__header__title--has-action`, `.ld-panel__header__title-action`, `.violation-item`, `.monaco-iframe-container`, `.ld-box`, `.ld-user-archived`, `.configuration-section`, `.service-turned-off`, `.configuration-section--last`, `.ld-splash`, `.ld-page__header`, `.ld-page__title`, `.ld-page--narrow-centered`, `.ld-arrange` and modifiers as well as BEM children, `.ld-card--flat-bare`, `.ld-card--bare`, `.ld-circle`, `.li-droplist-entry--tabs`, `.ld-article-list-panel`, `.ld-document-state-icon` and modifiers as well as BEM children, `.li-tab`and modifiers, `.ld-media-edit-image`

**Required Actions**
You are highly encouraged to update your markup if you should be using any of the deleted or renamed classes. In order to ease that process, there is a file you can `@import` in your custom SCSS to get support for the mentioned classes and variables:
In the SCSS file you have configured as `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_BEFORE` or `CUSTOM_STYLE_PATH_AFTER` add this line at the top:
```sass
@import "~styles/backwards-compatibility/release-2022-07.scss";
```
This will define the removed classes within your SCSS file tree. Your custom UI will most probably look just fine. From there on you can refactor your code and remove the `@import "~styles/backwards-compatibility/release-2022-07.scss";` after you are done. We will keep this file around for some time, but it will eventually get removed. If you have any questions about this, don't hesitate to contact us.

### Multi Selection can be disabled :fire:

Whilst we continue to refine the selection across multiple components we have enabled a config to turn it off. In the editable settings set `multiEditablesTextSelection: false`.

- [Documentation](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference-docs/editor-extensions/editor-configuration/editing-features/#multi-select-and-multi-text-select)

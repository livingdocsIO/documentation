## Release Notes

* **Current Release**: The latest announced release
* **Maintained Releases**: Get security fixes and severe bug fixes.
* **Upcoming Release**: You can already read about the features, improvements and fixes of the next release. But be aware that the release notes are auto generated and will be manually fixed before we officially anounce the new release.
* **Legacy Release**: Legacy releases do not receive bugfixes anymore. If you use an old release please notify us (release@livingdocs.io) so we are aware and can inform you of critical fixes in newer releases.

## How to install a Livingdocs release/patch

Every release gets a `label` ([dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose)) as soon as it's out. If you want to update your editor to the September 2021 release, you have to update your package.json like that:

```js
// package.json with a label for the livingdocs editor
"dependencies": {
  "@livingdocs/editor": "release-2021-09",
  // ...
}

// As an alternative you can also use a version number with a ~ to only allow patch updates
// The minor (72) and major (13) version keep the same for every release, just the patch (38) version will be increased
// To find out the minor/major version for a release, you have to go to the release notes of a release and check the
// patch section
"dependencies": {
  "@livingdocs/editor": "~72.13.38",
  // ...
}
```

As soon as a maintained release is out, we only add bug fixes and security patches to a release. When a new patch version arrives, the label `release-2021-09` will automatically moved to the latest patch version. This means, you can patch your project with this workflow:

```js
// install definition in package-lock.json
npm ci

// get currently installed version
npm list | grep @livingdocs/editor

// update package-lock of the editor based on the definition of package.json
npm update @livingdocs/editor

// after the update you can check if the version has been updated
// and then you can commit the change
npm list | grep @livingdocs/editor
```

Info: [Rili (Beta)](https://rili.cluster.livingdocs.io/) is a small helper service to find out the latest version of a release.

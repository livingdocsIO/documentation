## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Tech Release Notes Creation Guidelines (// TODO move to release cut checklist)

- System Requirements
  - Suggested
  - Minimal
- Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥
  - list related PRs (for internal use, customers don't have access to code base)
  - explain how to migrate or configs to change with example
  - Migrate the Postgres Database :fire:
    - always the same standard migration command
- Deprecations
  - list related PRs (for internal use, customers don't have access to code base)
  - explain how to migrate or change configs and downstream customization to keep things compatible
- APIs :gift:
  - list related PRs (for internal use, customers don't have access to code base)
  - example of how to use the new API
  - link to documentation
- Features :gift:
  - only list features that have some kind of config changes - write these notes with the developers in mind (if the feature is listed here then it should also be in the dev webinar and vice versa)
  - Small description with config changes example
  - link to documentation
- Improvements
  - only list technical improvements or improvements that need a config change - write these notes with the developers in mind
  - Small description with code example
  - link to documentation (if there is any)
- Bugfixes :beetle:
  - Bugfixes are fixes made during the release cycle
  - List bugfixes which
    - have been reported by customers
    - which have fixed some major broken functionality (if we fixed an console error which most likely did not affect user's or developer's work then we don't need to list it here)
    - which is a bug that existed in last release (sometimes we may break something on master during the release development and then fix it right away and the broken functionality never makes it into the release)
  - Description
- Patches
  - Bugfixes are fixes made after this release and are backported into this release

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-32313](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19
* [CVE-2023-32314](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-32695](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cqmj-92xf-r6r9) patched in `socket.io-parser` v4.2.4
* [CVE-2023-31125](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5) patched in `engine.io` v6.4.2

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Patches

Here is a list of all patches after the release has been announced.

### Livingdocs Server Patches
- [v231.0.2](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/releases/tag/v231.0.2): fix(routing): Use isolatedCacheFactory instead of persistent in-process cache for route builders

### Livingdocs Editor Patches
- [v95.0.5](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/releases/tag/v95.0.5): fix(quick publish): correctly show quick publish button if allowed

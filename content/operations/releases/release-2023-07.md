## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

### Migrate the Postgres Database ðŸ”¥

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database schema
# migration 192-remove-unused-columns.js
#   removes unused columns from the database
# migration 193-increase-document-title-length.js
#   increases the length of the document title to 1000 characters
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop support for Node v16

ðŸ”¥ Drop support for Node 16 as it will reach End-of-life in September, use Node v20 instead.

* [Server: Remove Nodev16 support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5809)
* [Editor: Remove Nodev16 support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7044)

### Removal `useAsTitle` ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Support for `useAsTitle` has been removed.
If you are currently using an `li-text` plugin with `useAsTitle: true`, please migrate to [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}). You will have to remove the `useAsTitle` from the metadata and introduce `displayTitlePattern: '{{metadata.title}}'` to maintain the functionality, where `title` is handle for an `li-text` plugin.
Please bear in mind that Editor toolbar behaviour will change, and it will no longer be possible to change the title of the article from the toolbar. The title will only be editable in the `li-text` plugin.
Please also make sure that `document.title` is no longer accessed in custom code, e.g. in Includes since this would leak the internal Working Title to the public.

* [Server: Remove `useAsTitle`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5763)
* [Editor: Remove `useAsTitle`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6949)

### Rename searchPublications property `conditions` to `filters`

ðŸ”¥ Rename `conditions` property to `filters`
When calling `searchManager.searchPublications()` directly, and providing the new `conditions` property in the first argument, please rename that property to `filters`.
Please note that the old `filters` property was renamed to `legacyFilters`.
This rename is part of the refactor done for the new [Search DSL](#search-dsl).
* [Rename `searchPublications()` property `conditions` to `filters`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5744)

### Rename searchPublications property `filters` to `legacyFilters`

ðŸ”¥ Rename `filters` property to `legacyFilters`
When calling `searchManager.searchPublications()` directly, and providing the new `conditions` property in the first argument, please rename the property to `legacyFilters` for a quick backwards compatibility fix.
The preferred update path would be to use `filters` from the new [Search DSL](#search-dsl).

* [Rename `searchPublications()` property `filters` to `legacyFilters`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5744)

### Removal Seed API

ðŸ”¥ The Seed API feature has been removed. If you were still using it, you should consider using Document/Publication API or Import API instead.
    You can find more information in [Import API documentation]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/import-api.md" >}}).

* [Remove seed API](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5767)

### Removal Proposals feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove proposals feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6910)

### Removal Cache feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove `li-cache` feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5751)

### Removal `liImageProxy` feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case. If you were still using it, you should use imgix or another Image Service provider instead. [More information]({{< ref "/guides/media-library/image-services.md" >}}).

* [Remove `liImageProxy` feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5772)

## Deprecations

### `searchPublications()` property `legacyFilters`

The `legacyFilters` property (previously named `filters`) of the first argument passed to `searchManager.searchPublications()` has been deprecated, and will be removed in `release-2023-09`.
This only exists to provide a bit of additional time to migrate any queries to the new [Search DSL](#search-dsl).

### Preview API

Preview API is deprecated and removed with `release-2023-09`: `previewApi.registerRenderFunction`, migrate to `documentApi.registerPreviewFunction`.

## APIs :gift:

### Add Api endpoint for incoming references for drafts

New draft endpoint for incoming document references: `/drafts/:documentId/incomingDocumentReferences`. Needs `public-api:drafts:read privileges`. [Learn more]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/drafts/incoming-references.md" >}})

### Public API Search Filters

A `filters` query parameter can now be provided to the `GET /api/v1/publications/search` endpoint.
The filters value should be a JSON (stringified) array or object, using the new [Search DSL](#search-dsl).

```
GET /api/v1/publications/search?filters=[{"key":"metadata.title","term":"My Title"}]
```

Below is an example showing how query expressions and logical operators can be combined to create a complex query:

```js
const filters = {
  or: [
    {
      and: [
        {
          key: 'metadata.count',
          range: {lte: 2}
        },
        {
          key: 'metadata.bool',
          exists: true
        },
        {
          not: {
            key: 'metadata.title',
            term: 'My Title'
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      key: 'metadata.count',
      term: 3
    }
  ]
}

// Public API request
const response = await fetch(`api/v1/publications/search?filters=${JSON.stringify(filters)}`)
const results = await response.json()
```

The `filters` object from the example above can also be passed to the `publicApi.searchPublications()` method.

```js
// Public API server feature
const publicApi = server.features.api('li-public-api')
const results = await publicApi.searchPublications({projectId: 1, filters})
```

Please also check the [Public API Search DSL]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/publications/search#search-filters" >}}) documentation for more details.

## Features :gift:

For a business level explanation of the new features please check [July Release Notes](https://livingdocs.io/en/livingdocs-release-july-2023)

- [Display Filters ListV2 with OR combination](#display-filters-listv2-with-or-combination)
- [Document Preview](#document-preview)
- [Search DSL](#search-dsl)
- [Translatable li-tree plugin](#translatable-li-tree-plugin)

### Display Filters ListV2 with OR combination

The Filters ListV2 have been extended to support multiple selections. The selected values are `OR` combined in the search query. [Learn more]({{< ref "/guides/editor/custom-dashboard-filters/index.md#example-multi-value-filter" >}})

Configure a multi-value filter:

```js
liEditor.searchFilters.registerListV2('MultiSelectV2Filter', {
  multiple: true, // allow multiple selections
  datasource: {
    ...
  },
  ...
})
```

### Document Preview

You can use HTML or iFrame as return format when using the Document Preview feature.
To enable Document Previews, you first need to register a preview function in the server. Then, define the handles in `editorSettings.documentPreviews` from the Project Config. Finally, enable the document preview in the desired content types. When using HTML scroll position will be preserved automatically when the user reloads the preview, but if you use iFrame you will have to let Livingdocs know using a postMessage interface. [Learn more]({{< ref "/guides/editor/document-previews/index.md" >}}).

Register Document Preview Functions in the server:
```js
liServer.registerInitializedHook(async () => {
  const documentApi = liServer.features.api('li-documents').document

// return html ...
documentApi.registerPreviewFunction({
  handle: 'myHtmlPreviewFunction',
  async getPreview ({projectConfig, documentId}) {
    const doc = await documentApi.getLatestDocument(documentId)
    return {
      html: `<div><h1>Title: ${doc.title}</h1><p>This is a custom preview</p></div>`
    }
  }
})

// ... or an iframe
documentApi.registerPreviewFunction({
    handle: 'myIframePreviewFunction',
    async getPreview ({projectConfig, documentId}) {
      return {
        iframe: {
          src: `https://example.com/my-preview/${documentId}`,
          sandbox: 'allow-same-origin' // make sure this is set if you want to preserve scroll position
        }
      }
    }
  })
```

Configure Document Previews in the project config:
```js
// editorSettings
{
  documentPreviews: [
    {
      handle: 'htmlPreview',
      previewFunction: 'myHtmlPreviewFunction',
      icon: 'book-edit',
      label: 'Preview'
    },
    {
      handle: 'iframePreview',
      previewFunction: 'myIframePreviewFunction',
      icon: 'pencil',
      label: {
        de: 'Meine Seite',
        en: 'My Site'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Enable Document Previews in the content type config:
```js
{
  handle: 'myContentType',
  // ...
  // for documentPreviews, define the handles of editorSettings.documentPreviews
  documentPreviews: ['iframePreview', 'htmlPreview']
}
```

### Search DSL

The elasticsearch indexing and filter functionality received major updates. With this release we're introducing a new search DSL, which can be used in base filters of dashboards and also in display filter implementations.

Please follow the [migration guide for display filters and base filters]({{< ref "/guides/editor/filter-migration" >}}).  
Please also check the [Public API Search DSL]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/publications/search#search-filters" >}}) documentation for details how to use it there.

The new DSL builds up on logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), or a query expression property (`term`, `exists`, `range`). The logical operator values can be either arrays or objects. The query expression properties should have the value you are filtering for, and they must be combined with a `key` property. The default top level array or object behaviour is that of an AND logical expression.

For example:
```js
[
  {key: 'contentType', term: 'regular-article'},
  {
    or: [
      {key: 'metadata.proofreadingTask.state', term: 'requested'},
      {key: 'metadata.imageEnhancementTask.state', term: 'requested'}
    ]
  }
]
```

By default all metadata properties in a custom metadata mapping are included. So you can filter them directly.

Additionally we have a new `index: true` configuration [within the metadata property declaration]({{< ref "/guides/search/publication-index#metadata-plugins" >}}) to support automatic indexing without causing elasticsearch mapping conflicts. We advise to this new attribute instead of a static mapping.
### Translatable li-tree plugin

li-tree plugin has new config `multilang` to support multiple languages on items: [Learn more]({{< ref "/reference/document/metadata/plugins/li-tree" >}})

Metadata config in project config:

```js
metadata: [
  {
    handle: 'tree',
    type: 'li-tree',
    config: {
      multilang: true,
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
]
```

### UI and label config multi-language support

With this release, we introduced multi-language support for the UI and label config. Currently we support English and German as UI languages: [Learn more]({{< ref "/guides/editor/multi-language-ui/index.md" >}})

Set UI language in editor config:

```js
app: {
  locale: 'de'
}
```

Configure multi language metadata plugin label in project config:

```js
metadata: [
  {
    handle: 'category',
    ui: {
      label: {
        en: 'Category',
        de: 'Kategorie'
      },
    },
    ...
  },
]
```

### Support significantPublicationDate on document import

Property `significantPublicationDate` sets a date which deliveries can display to viewers: [Learn more]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/imports/documents.md" >}})

When performing a `POST api/v1/import/documents` request, you can define `significantPublicationDate` within `documents.[].publishControl` object. See example below:

```js
{
  "systemName": "identifier-for-your-system",
  ...,
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "123abc",
      ...,
      "publishControl": {
        "significantPublicationDate": "1999-03-19T17:27:00.107Z",
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

### Copy Target Icon and Label Config

The copy target config has been extended to support an icon and a label: [Learn more]({{< ref "/guides/editor/document-copy/index.md#setup-config" >}})

Copy config in project config:

```js
copy: [
  {
    source: {...},
    targets: [
      {
        label: 'Web Article',
        icon: 'web',
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-32313](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19
* [CVE-2023-32314](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-32695](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cqmj-92xf-r6r9) patched in `socket.io-parser` v4.2.4
* [CVE-2023-31125](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5) patched in `engine.io` v6.4.2

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

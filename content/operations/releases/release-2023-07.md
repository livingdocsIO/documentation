## Caveat :fire:

These are the release notes of the upcoming release (pull requests merged to master).

- :information_source: this document is updated automatically by a bot (pr's to categorize section)
- :information_source: this document will be roughly updated manually once a week (put PRs + description to the right section)
- :fire: We don't guarantee stable APIs. They can still change until the official release
- :fire: Integration against the upcoming release (currently `master` branch) is at your own risk

## Tech Release Notes Creation Guidelines (TODO move to release cut checklist)

- System Requirements
  - Suggested
  - Minimal
- Breaking Changes 🔥

    - always the same standard migration command
- Deprecations
  - list related PRs (for internal use, customers don't have access to code base)
  - explain how to migrate or change configs and downstream customization to keep things compatible
- APIs :gift:
  - list related PRs (for internal use, customers don't have access to code base)
  - example of how to use the new API
  - link to documentation
- Features :gift:
  - only list features that have some kind of config changes - write these notes with the developers in mind (if the feature is listed here then it should also be in the dev webinar and vice versa)
  - Small description with config changes example
  - link to documentation
- Improvements
  - only list technical improvements or improvements that need a config change - write these notes with the developers in mind
  - Small description with code example
  - link to documentation (if there is any)
- Bugfixes :beetle:

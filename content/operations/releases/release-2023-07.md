## Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

### Migrate the Postgres Database ðŸ”¥

It's a simple/fast migration with no expected data losses.

```sh
# run `livingdocs-server migrate up` to update to the newest database scheme
livingdocs-server migrate up
```

### Drop support for Node v16

ðŸ”¥ Drop support for Node 16 as it will reach End-of-life in September, use Node v20 instead.

* [Server: Remove Nodev16 support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5809)
* [Editor: Remove Nodev16 support](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/7044)

### Removal `useAsTitle` ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ Support for `useAsTitle` has been removed.
If you are currently using an `li-text` plugin with `useAsTitle: true`, please migrate to [displayTitlePattern]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#displaytitlepattern" >}}). You will have to remove the `useAsTitle` from the metadata and introduce `displayTitlePattern: '{{metadata.title}}'` to maintain the functionality, where `title` is handle for an `li-text` plugin.
Please bear in mind that Editor toolbar behaviour will change, and it will no longer be possible to change the title of the article from the toolbar. The title will only be editable in the `li-text` plugin.
Please also make sure that `document.title` is no longer accessed in custom code, e.g. in Includes since this would leak the internal Working Title to the public.

* [Server: Remove `useAsTitle`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5763)
* [Editor: Remove `useAsTitle`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6949)

### Removal `ui.component`

ðŸ”¥ Configuring `ui.component` for metadata plugins does not work anymore.

### Rename searchPublications property `conditions` to `filters`

ðŸ”¥ Rename `conditions` property to `filters`
When calling `searchManager.searchPublications()` directly, and providing the new `conditions` property in the first argument, please rename that property to `filters`.
Please note that the old `filters` property was renamed to `legacyFilters`.
This rename is part of the refactor done for the new [search DSL](#search-dsl).
* [Rename `searchPublications()` property `conditions` to `filters`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5744)

### Rename searchPublications property `filters` to `legacyFilters`

ðŸ”¥ Rename `filters` property to `legacyFilters`
When calling `searchManager.searchPublications()` directly, and providing the new `conditions` property in the first argument, please rename the property to `legacyFilters` for a quick backwards compatibility fix.
The preferred update path would be to use `filters` from the new [search DSL](#search-dsl).

* [Rename `searchPublications()` property `filters` to `legacyFilters`](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5744)

### Removal Seed API

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove seed API](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5767)

### Removal Proposals feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove proposals feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/6910)

### Removal Cache feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove `li-cache` feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5751)

### Removal `liImageProxy` feature

ðŸ”¥ Features wasn't in use an didn't cover any use case.

* [Remove `liImageProxy` feature](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/5772)

## Deprecations

### `searchPublications()` property `legacyFilters`

The `legacyFilters` property (previously named `filters`) of the first argument passed to `searchManager.searchPublications()` has been deprecated, and will be removed in `release-2023-09`.
This only exists to provide a bit of additional time to migrate any queries to the new Search DSL.

### Preview API

Preview API is deprecated and removed with `release-2023-09`: `previewApi.registerRenderFunction`, migrate to `documentApi.registerPreviewFunction`.

## APIs :gift:

### Add Api endpoint for incoming references for drafts

New draft endpoint for incoming document references: `/drafts/:documentId/incomingDocumentReferences`. Needs `public-api:drafts:read privileges`.

## Vulnerability Patches

We are constantly patching module vulnerabilities for the Livingdocs Server and Livingdocs Editor as module fixes are available. Below is a list of all patched vulnerabilities included in the release.

### Livingdocs Server
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-32313](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19
* [CVE-2023-32314](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5) patched in `vm2` v3.9.19

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Server:
* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Server.

### Livingdocs Editor
This release we have patched the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:
* [CVE-2023-32695](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cqmj-92xf-r6r9) patched in `socket.io-parser` v4.2.4
* [CVE-2023-31125](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5) patched in `engine.io` v6.4.2

We are aware of the following vulnerabilities in the Livingdocs Editor:

* [CVE-2023-26102](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1321.html) has yet to be patched by `rangy` but we have proposed a fix in [this PR](https://github.com/timdown/rangy/pull/482)
  This vulnerability is not exploitable in the Livingdocs Editor because `rangy` module is scoped in the `livingdocs-framework` and not exposed to the users.
* [CVE-2023-26116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26118](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2023-26117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html), [CVE-2022-25869](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [CVE-2022-25844](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html) are all AngularJS vulnerabilities that don't have a patch available. We are working on removing all AngularJS from our code and vulnerabilities will go away when we complete the transition to Vue.js.

## Patches

### Livingdocs Server Patches
- [v231.0.2](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/releases/tag/v231.0.2): fix(routing): Use isolatedCacheFactory instead of persistent in-process cache for route builders

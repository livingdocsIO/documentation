## How to install a Livingdocs release/patch

Every release gets a `label` ([dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose)) as soon as it's out. If you want to update your editor to the September 2021 release, you have to update your package.json like that:

```js
// package.json with a label for the livingdocs editor
"dependencies": {
  "@livingdocs/editor": "release-2021-09",
  // ...
}

// As an alternative you can also use a version number with a ~ to only allow patch updates
// The minor (72) and major (13) version keep the same for every release, just the patch (38) version will be increased
// To find out the minor/major version for a release, you have to go to the release notes of a release and check the
// patch section
"dependencies": {
  "@livingdocs/editor": "~72.13.38",
  // ...
}
```

As soon as a maintained release is out, we only add bug fixes and security patches to a release. When a new patch version arrives, the label `release-2021-09` will automatically moved to the latest patch version. This means, you can patch your project with this workflow:

```js
// install definition in package-lock.json
npm ci

// get currently installed version
npm list | grep @livingdocs/editor

// update package-lock of the editor based on the definition of package.json
npm update @livingdocs/editor

// after the update you can check if the version has been updated
// and then you can commit the change
npm list | grep @livingdocs/editor
```

Info: [Rili (Beta)](https://rili.cluster.livingdocs.io/) is a small helper service to find out the latest version of a release.

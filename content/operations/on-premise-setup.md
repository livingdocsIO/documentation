## Get Code Access

For an on premise solution you need access to private Livingdocs repositories.

To get access you will need a Github account and drop us an email: <contact@livingdocs.io>.

Until you have access you can use our service at <https://edit.livingdocs.io> for your evaluation. All Livingdocs features except server- and editor extensions are also available in the service.


## Boilerplates

Once you have access you can download our boilerplates for the livingdocs-server and the livingdocs-editor.

Both the server and the editor ship with a default configuration, that works out of the box with the Dockerfiles we provide.

  If you get a <strong>404 - Not Found</strong> for the repos below this means you do not have access to Livingdocs on Github.

## System Requirements

### Operating system

Livingdocs runs under Mac OSX, Linux and Windows 10 (in a linux docker container). For Windows 10 proceed first to [setup Windows 10]({{< ref "/guides/setup/setup-windows.md" >}})

### Prerequisites

In order to setup and run a Livingdocs application on your local machine, you need to make sure that the following programs and libraries are installed and publicly available on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Probably the world's most used Javascript runtime. Livingdocs is written in Javascript, so this one is definitely a hard requirement. You find installation instructions for all operating systems on their website. We recommmend using [FNM](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install and also upgrade Node.js. It allows installing multiple versions in parallel.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) - Very broadly, Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. We use it to run our storage services (databases, search index and so on) on your local machine.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - Everybody's favorite distributed version control software. We use it extensively and, let's be honest, chances are you are too.
- [local certificate](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/blob/master/config/cert.js) - Due to security reasons some features require a valid SSL/TLS setup and running the editor with HTTPS.

On a lower note, you'll also need active Github and Docker accounts respectively.

## Download the Boilerplates

### Get the code

Create a new directory, change to it and clone our boilerplate repositories from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate
git clone https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor-boilerplate
```

Now, what did you get?

Within `livingdocs-server-boilerplate` we have a default configuration for a Livingdocs Server instance. This server, once up and running, will take care of a variety of things, from persisting your documents to search indexation â€“ however, it is exclusively data driven or [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software).

The second folder `livingdocs-editor-boilerplate` contains a default configuration for a Livingdocs Editor instance, our editing user interface.

### The `ENVIRONMENT` variable

With this value, we determine under what kind of base premise the services should get run. At this point, we only need to know, that for a local setup we always want that value to be set to `local`.
You can either call the following line before each and every script or permanently set the environment variable by adding the line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=local
```


## Proceed with the Boilerplate READMEs

Next, follow the instructions in each repository's README:

{{< warning >}}
  If you get a <strong>404 - Not Found</strong> for the repos below this means you do not have access to Livingdocs on Github.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< github "livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor-boilerplate" "[Private Repo] On Premise Editor Template" >}}

{{< github "livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate" "[Private Repo] On Premise Server Template" >}}


**Please note**
These boilerplates are _not_ meant to be used for anything else than local evaluation. They also include configurations for rate limited third-party API's that we provide for convenience reasons.

## Setting up required services and accounts

For your convenience we provide evaluation accounts for e.g. image storage or sending mails so you can start exploring the boilerplate right away.

But before starting to develop in earnest you will have set up your own accounts.

### Account Checklist

#### File Storage (e.g. AWS S3)

All files you upload to Livingdocs will be stored in your storages. For this to work you need to configure your own supported storage.

On AWS for example we recommend to create four buckets per environment (for images, videos, files and design assets).

Server Config Keys to update:
  * `mediaLibrary.images.storage.*`
  * `mediaLibrary.videos.storage.*`
  * `mediaLibrary.files.storage.*`
  * `designs.assets.storage.*`

#### Image Service (e.g. Imgix)

Images in Livingdocs are usually displayed through an image service to handle image resizing and cropping. You should configure your own service per environment.

Server Config Keys to update:
  * `documents.imageServices.*`

#### Pusher

In order for real-time collaboration to work as designed you will have to set up an account on [pusher.com](https://pusher.com).

Server Config Keys to update:
  * `pusher.*`

Once you have created a `Pusher` channel, you can go to `App settings` and make sure `enable authorized connections` is toggled off (default value). If you enable this setting, you might encounter a `Websocket error` when idling in the editor's landing page.

NOTE: Disabling this setting should not have any side effect. Malicious users would need to log in to the editor to access those websockets.

#### Email (e.g. AWS SES)

The livingdocs-server needs to send mails for things like password resets or user notifications. For this you should configure an E-Mail with a trusted domain of yours which you should also communicate to your users so they know from which sender to expect Livingdocs E-Mails. We recommend to create different E-Mail accounts for different environments.

Server Config Keys to update:
  * `notifications.channels.email.fromAddress`
  * `emails.transport.default.*`

#### NPM Access Token

To access private Livingdocs repositories you need to create an npm user with an access token. We can then grant your npm user read access to our @livingdocs packages (e.g. `@livingdocs/livingdocs-server` and `@livingdocs/livingdocs-editor`).

We recommend adding an `.npmrc` file to your server and editor repositories so everyone in your team can run `npm install` seamlessly.

.npmrc file:

```ini
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=<yourNpmToken>
```

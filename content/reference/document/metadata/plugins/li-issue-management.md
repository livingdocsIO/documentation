  The `li-issue-management` metadata plugin can be used to manage issues (a data-record with references to pages).

  {{< img src="../images/li-issue-management-overview.png" alt="Issue management overview" >}}

  Note: The status of pages and articles does not update automatically. Please refresh the page to get an up-to-date overview.

  Issue management plugin:

  * Page status, article count and status
  * Create and add new pages
  * Open pages
  * View and open page articles
  * Remove pages (this will not delete the page, only remove the reference from this issue)
  * Disable / enable a page reference for this issue
  * Change order of pages

  Issue navigation:

  * Navigate between the issue and its pages
  * Summary status of page and its articles

  {{< img src="../images/li-issue-management-page-view.png" alt="Issue management page view" >}}

  The issue navigation is also visible when navigating to a page that belongs to an issue.

  The issue navigation can only show one issue at a time. If a page is connected to two issues then only the first issue will be shown in the issue navigation.

  When a contentType (in this example a "page") is a member of an issue, then then all the "Un-/Publish" buttons in the publish control will be named "Release/Withdraw". See Project Config below.

  {{< img src="../images/li-issue-management-view-articles.png" alt="Issue management view articles" >}}

  See and open articles of the selected page.

  {{< img src="../images/li-issue-management-remove.png" alt="Issue management remove page" >}}

  Removing a page reference has to be confirmed in a second step, to prevent accidental removal.

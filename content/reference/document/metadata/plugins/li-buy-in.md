description: |
  As part of the Planning System, users want to ask for buy-in when writing an article or pitching an idea.
  Other users can express their backing by accepting a buy-in request.
  The presence, absence or status of a buy-in request has no effect on permissions and is just a communication tool.

  * A buy-in request is closed after it was accepted or declined by one other person
  * Users cannot respond to their own buy-in requests
  * All other users with read and write permissions to the document can respond to a buy-in request
  * Buy-in requests can be answered by returning them to the creator, e.g. to clarify questions before accepting the request
  * Closed buy-in requests can be reopened an unlimited number of times
  * Buy-in requests can be answered directly from a Table Dashboard
  * Expired buy-in requests remain in their state, but may disappear from Table Dashboards (depends on config)
  * All own actions can be undone if no other action has occurred afterwards
  * All own comments can be edited, but will be marked as such

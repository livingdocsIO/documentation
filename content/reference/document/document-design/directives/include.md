Includes allow you to define parts of your markup that will be controlled from a third-party micro-service. Examples are services like highcharts or mathjax that render HTML given a set of given parameters and config. HTML is not only rendered one-time but evaluated on every request.

## Example

```js
{
  name: 'echo',
  label: 'Echo',
  iconUrl: 'https://livingdocs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/magazine-design/assets/images/icons-components/icon_image.svg',
  directives: [
    {
      name: 'foo',
      type: 'include',
      service: 'foo-service',
      config: {
        language: 'en'
      },
      defaultParams: {
        tag: 'livingdocs'
      }
    }
  ],
  html: dedent`
    <div doc-include="foo">
      <div>Foo Service</div>
    </div>
  `
}
```

## Config Options
### Parameters

- `config`: object, allows you to pass static configuration to your third-party microservice. In the example above we pass a language as a fixed config.
- `defaultParams`: object, allows you to define defaults for the dynamic params of an include. Dynamic params are set by the user over a UI in the editor and are defined in the [Settings for the include]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/settings" >}}).

### Service definition

The service defines what kind of include is inserted, i.e. the microservice to use for rendering.
You can define one service (`service`) or an array of `services` in which case the editor will provide a dropdown to change the service dynamically on a component.

- `service`, string, name of the service used to render the HTML within the tag. Service name [must be registered]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/settings" >}}).
- `services`, array, defines a set of services that can be changed manually in the editor, each service contains each own service name, default params and config.

schema of services:
```js
services: ms.arrayOf(ms.strictObj({
  service: 'string:required',
  label: 'string:required',
  defaultParams: ms.obj(),
  config: ms.obj()
}))
```

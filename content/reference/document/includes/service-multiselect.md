So far we have seen configurations where a `doc-include` directive has one include service. It is possible though to configure multiple services behind a directive.

```html
<script type="ld-conf">
{
  "name": "top-news",
  "label": "Top News",
  "directives": {
    "top-news": {
      "services": [
        {
          "service": "list",
          "label": "Manual List",
          "defaultParams": {
            "layout": "topNews"
          },
          "config": {
            "minCount": 5,
            "maxCount": 5
          }
        },
        {
          "service": "categoryList",
          "label": "Automatic List",
          "defaultParams": {
            "layout": "topNews"
          },
          "config": {
            "minCount": 5,
            "maxCount": 5
          }
        },
        {
          "service": "scheduledList",
          "label": "Scheduled List",
          "defaultParams": {
            "layout": "topNews"
          },
          "config": {
            "minCount": 5,
            "maxCount": 5
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>

<div doc-include="top-news">
  <div class="embed top-news">
    <div class="placeholder"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The example shows one component "Top News". This component has only one directive `top-news`. Instead of a single service the `top-news` directive has an array of services in its configuration. The use case is quite simple: Top News is a geometry on a start page. It can be filled either manually (`list` service), automatically (`categoryList` service) or have a time schedule for the future (`scheduledList` service). Instead of doing 3 components for this, the `services` (array) configuration allows you to re-use the geometry of the "Top News" component and give the user in the editor the ability to switch between the defined services.

The screenshot above shows the multiselect option in the sidebar. The rendering of the selected "Top News" component will always look the same only the underlying `doc-include` service (and thus the editor user interface as well as the server rendering) change.

In order to have the same look across all services, all registered [service renderers]({{< ref "/reference/document/includes/server-customization" >}}) on the server must render into the same HTML template.

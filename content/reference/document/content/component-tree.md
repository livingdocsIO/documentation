A component tree is a tree of [components]({{< ref "./component-model" >}}). Just like the DOM is a tree of DOM nodes.

Schematic example of a `componentTree`:

```
- ComponentContainer (root)
 - Component 'Hero'
 - Component '2 Columns'
   - ComponentContainer 'main'
     - Component 'Title'
   - ComponentContainer 'sidebar'
     - Component 'Info-Box'
```

## Methods

#### Create components

```js
// Create a component
const title = componentTree.createComponent('title')
```

#### Insert components

```js
// Insert a component at the beginning.
componentTree.prepend(title)

// Insert component at the end.
componentTree.append(title)
```

#### Traverse and find components

```js
// Traverse through each component
componentTree.each((component) => {
    // your code
})

// Traverse through each container
componentTree.eachContainer((container) => {
    // your code
})

// Traverse through each component and container
componentTree.all((componentOrContainer) => {
    // your code
})

// Find all components of a type
const subtitles = componentTree.find('subtitle')
if (subtitles.length) {
    const subtitleComponent = subtitles[0]
}

// Get the first component in a document
const firstComponent = componentTree.first()
```


#### Serialize

```js
componentTree.toJson()
```

This method is called by `Livingdoc.toJson()` internally.


#### Development Helpers

```js
// Get a readable string of the whole componentTree
componentTree.print()
```


## Change Events

A `componentTree` issues events whenever a change happens. You can subscribe to those events to get notified of changes. Internally views listen to the `componentTree` for changes to update the DOM.


- **componentAdded**
  Get notified when a component was added
- **componentRemoved**
  Get notified when a component was deleted
- **componentMoved**
  Get notified when a component has changed its position
- **componentContentChanged**
  Get notified when the content of a component changed. (E.g. the user has edited a text)
- **componentHtmlChanged**
  Get notified when component settings changed. For example a css class.
- **changed**
  Get notified of all changes in a document. Fires when any of the above events for any component fires.

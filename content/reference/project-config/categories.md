The categories are normally used together with the routing system to represent the idiomatic department structure in a newspaper. Read our [Setup Categories Guide]({{< ref "/guides/organisation/categories-and-routing.md" >}}) for more infos on the actual use cases.

You can define an array of available categories:
```js
categories: [
  {
    id: 'home',
    label: 'Home',
    path: '/',
    parent:
    archived: false,
    metadata: {
      foo: 'bar' // You can store arbitrary data here
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'breaking-news',
    label: 'Breaking News',
    path: '/breaking',
    parent: 'home',
    archived: false,
    metadata: {
      bar: 'foo'
    }
  }
]
```

Categories can have a path for the routing.

They should never be deleted but the `archived` flag set to true.

Categories have a `metadata` object that contain additional information such as ad campaign ids for a certain category (e.g. ads specific to the "Sports" category).

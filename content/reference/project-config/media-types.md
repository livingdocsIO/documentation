## Changelog

In the last few months we have substantially extended the media library. To show you what changed in what release, we provide you a changelog.

#### Add Image Support

`Media Types` describe the content you can manage in the Media Library. You can configure the metadata you want to manage per `Media Type` by using the same metadata schema as on Content-Types. The Media Library will provide forms to edit this data.
If no `Media Type` config is provided it falls back to a default config where `title`, `caption`, `source` and `description` will be taken as metadata.

- Add image support with the new type `mediaImage`.
- You can only configure 1 mediaType and it has to have the handle `image`.
- Only one `type` is supported: `mediaImage`

#### Add Video Support

- Add video support with the new type `mediaVideo`.
- Multiple Media Types of type `mediaImage` are supported, but at least one Media Type must have the handle `image`

#### Add Configurability of Media Library Index / Multiple Videos
{{< added-in release-2021-03 >}}

- Includes `index` on config
- You can configure which metadata should be indexed on the media index. The metadata plugin must support the media index. Set in `config` property `index:true`
- upstream plugins which support media index
   - li-text
   - li-boolean
   - li-enum
   - li-integer
   - li-numeric-list
   - li-string-list
   - li-google-vision
- Multiple Media Types of type `mediaVideo` are supported, but at least one Media Type must have the handle `video`

#### Add File Support
{{< added-in release-2021-06 >}}

- Add file support with the new type `mediaFile`

#### Add Dashboard Card Config Support

- The card (UI Component or configured dashboard card) to be used for a mediaType in a Media Library Dashboard can be configured
## Example

```js
mediaTypes: [{
  handle: 'image', // the handle is free, but one mediaImage must have the handle 'image'
  type: 'mediaImage',
  info: {
    label: 'Image',
    description: 'Media type for images'
  }

      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    }
  ]
}]
```

## Metadata

The metadata follows the rules that also apply to document metadata [defined on a content-type]({{< ref "content-types.md#metadata" >}}). All the same metadata plugins are available. Different from the document metadata, media metadata does not have UI support as of now.

## Exif Extraction
This feature is only supported for the `mediaImage` mediaType.

Whenever in image file is stored in the Media Library, we can extract the IPTC data from the image file and store it in the metadata.
You can configure this behavior with the `mappings` defined in `exifExtraction`.

We follow https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata and provide a mapping of the field names (and some aliases) to the actual value in IMM or XMP, following the standard with best effort. If the same field is available in IIM and XMP defined fields, we prefer the one in XMP. And example for this is the field `Creator` (https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#creator). It was first defined in IIM as `2:80 By-line`. Later it was renamed in XMP to `dc:creator`. Both fields have effectively the same meaning: "Contains the name of the photographer, but in cases where the photographer should not be identified the name of a company or organisation may be appropriate."
You can extract this field by using either `Creator` or `By-line` as the value for `field` in a mapping, for example:

```
{
  field: 'By-line',
  metadataPropertyName: 'creator'
}
```

We found inconsistencies with the EXIF data provided in different images. If you have any problems with the extraction of these metadata, please provide us with an example file. We will try to improve our extraction system.

Here is a complete list of fields you can use. Please consult https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata for detailed descriptions of the meaning of the single fields.

## Media Sources


{{< added-in release-2021-03 block >}}

This feature is only supported for mediaTypes of type `mediaImage`.

With [Media Sources]({{< ref "/guides/media-library/media-sources" >}}) you can integrate asset research/import into Livingdocs. Instead of having to log in to another platform like Unsplash and then drag + drop images into Livingdocs, you can have Unsplash assets search results available directly in Livingdocs.

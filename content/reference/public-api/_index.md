## OpenAPI

The [Livingdocs Public API]({{< ref "/reference/public-api" >}}) can be tested and consumed with an [OpenAPI v3 specification file](https://docs.livingdocs.io/openapi.json).

Thanks to the [OpenAPI specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html), it's possible to quickly test the API using [Swagger UI](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://docs.livingdocs.io/openapi.json). And import the full collection of existing API endpoints into Insomnia or Postman.

The easiest way to import the endpoint collection is from a URL, both Postman and Insomnia support it.

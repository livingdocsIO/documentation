Weâ€™ve added a new public API endpoint:

`/api/2025-03/mediaLibrary/serve-image/:key`

This endpoint provides access to an image in its original dimensions, as long as it has not been revoked or marked as invalid. It can serve as a source for proxies or image processing services.

Please check the [API reference]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/media-library/#serve-image" >}}) for more details.

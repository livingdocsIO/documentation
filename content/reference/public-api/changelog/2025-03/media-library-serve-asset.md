A new public API endpoint, `/api/2025-03/mediaLibrary/serve-images/:key`, has been introduced, allowing access to the original image as long as it is not in an unavailable state, such as revoked or marked as invalid.

Please check the [API reference](/reference/public-api/media-library/) for more details.

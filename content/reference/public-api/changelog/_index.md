In the Public API Changelog youâ€™ll find an overview of all significant changes to our API, including new features, deprecations, and breaking changes. Our goal is to provide a clear and structured update history, helping you stay informed about improvements and necessary adjustments.

Please consult the [API Versioning Strategy]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/versioning" >}}) for more information on how we manage API versions.

Bug fixes are not listed here. If you encounter issues, please report them to the Livingdocs Customer Solutions team.

## Documentation

The CLI is used to modify setting in a live Livingdocs project, without the need to touch its code. 

It's the only way of changing project config and components if you are using the [Livingdocs Service](https://edit.livingdocs.io/).

The CLI is not made to interact with the [Public API](.././public-api), for that you can call directly the API or use the [Node SDK](.././sdk).

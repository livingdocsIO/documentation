Dashboard Display Filters do not have that much core support as Metadata Plugins, but there is always a better option than an Angular plugin:

1) The best option is to replace your Angular filter with one of the core filters [Named Filter or Metadata Filter]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter" >}})
2) The second best option is to replace it with a [Custom List V2 Filter]({{< ref "/guides/editor/custom-dashboard-filters" >}})
3) The least proposed solution is to create a [Custom Vue Component Filter]({{< ref "guides/editor/custom-dashboard-filters">}})

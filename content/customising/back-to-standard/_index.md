## What is Back to Standard?

Back to Standard means removing custom or deprecated features and plugins and replace them with a simpler solution. When you have developed a custom solution some time ago maybe you can now replace that with a core solution which has the same featureset than your custom solution.

Back to Standard is for customers which have old stuff like deprecated Angular plugins and search for ideas/guidance how to replace them.

If you miss a section, please get in contact with us.


## Why is Back to Standard important?

- We can better align features for you, because of less customisation via plugins
- You can replace custom solutions with simple core solutions (mostly configs)
- You can replace deprecated solutions (they will go away)
- You will have a better developer experience by simplifying the solutions and the business saves money
  - less code
  - less bugs
  - less maintenance
  - easier updates
- We can remove old code in the core (less maintenance costs)

## Roadmap

Migrating away from AngularJS can be a complex process, especially if you have a lot of downstream custom plugins. That's why we want to leave you enough time to make the transition.

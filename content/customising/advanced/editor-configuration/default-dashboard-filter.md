## Overview

Filters on a dashboard are highly customisable in Livingdocs.

- One can define filters with a UI to mutate the filter in a dashboard (`displayFilters`)
- One can define `baseFilters` that are invisible and always applied per dashboard
- One can use [Core DisplayFilter]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/editor-configuration/display-filter.md" >}}) or [Custom DisplayFilter]({{< ref "/guides/editor/custom-dashboard-filters" >}}).

See the [Table Dashboard configuration]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#displayfilters" >}}) documentation for more details.

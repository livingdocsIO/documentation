The multilist editor lets a user view and edit multiple document lists in one screen. It is available by default if
[List Teasers]({{< ref "./list-teasers" >}}) are configured such that list teaser
components are available for pages.

The multilist editor is accessible from the editor toolbar while editing a page:

It lets a user move documents between all lists that are included on the page, and between lists and the page's
[Document Inbox]({{< ref "/reference-docs/project-config/content-types#document-inbox" >}}):

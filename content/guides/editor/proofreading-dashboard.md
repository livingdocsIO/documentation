## Goal

Our goal of this walkthrough is to show how to set up a Proofreading Task Dashboard with Realtime Collaboration.

Key features
- You have your own dashboard with your own design card
- Your dashboard will be updated in realtime (when a task changes)
- You can change the priority of a proofreading task

# Guide

## 1) Add your own metadata field on the server

As a first step, you have to configure a proofreading task metadata field. Later this field will be used to show documents on the right place on the proofreading dashboard (sort order, filter, status)

```js
metadata: [
  {
    // handle of the proofreading metadata field
    handle: 'my-proofreading',
    type: 'li-task-v2',
    config: {
      label: 'My Proofreading',
      realtimeNotification: true,
      showInTaskList: true,
      // handle of the proofreading dashboard (the dashboard will be configured later in the editor)
      linkToDashboard: 'my-kanban-proofreading',
      setPriority: true
    }
  }
]
```

### Add my-proofreading to Elasticsearch
The metadata field `my-proofreading` should be searchable by the proofreading dashboard later. Therefore you have to extend the Elasticsearch document mapping.
You will find an example on the [server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/blob/cb91a7913149293e2d8562f98c085bb46da41d60/example-server/metadata/es_metadata_mapping_v6.json#L59-L118).

## 2) Register your custom dashboard on the editor

As a second step you have to register a custom dashboard in the project config.

```js
dashboards: [
  {
    handle: 'my-kanban-proofreading',
    type: 'taskBoard',
    pageTitle: 'My Proofreading',
    // This is the name of the previously added metadata field on the server
    taskName: 'my-proofreading',
    displayFilters: ['documentState', 'timeRange']
  }
]
```

- [Project Config]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings" >}})

## 3) Add your custom dashboard to the menu

As third step you can add the custom dashboard to the [main navigation]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings" >}}).

```js
{
  label: 'My Proofreading',
  // 'my-kanban-proofreading' is the dashboard handle configured in the last step
  dashboard: 'my-kanban-proofreading',
  icon: 'file-document'
}
```

:tada: After you have added your dashboard to the menu, you have a working custom realtime dashboard filtered by your custom metadata field :tada:

How to test it
- go to the tasks feature in the top bar of an article and change the status of your task
- go to the `My Proofreading` dashboard via the menu and look if your task is on the board

## 4) Customise a card on the dashboard

The default card on the `My Proofreading` dashboard is quite simple. If you want to implement your own card (with a custom behavior and also a custom look and feel), you have to register a card in your downstream editor and assign it to your custom dashboard.

```js
// extend the custom dashboard config from step 2 with your own card
dashboards: [
  {
    handle: 'my-kanban-proofreading',
    // other config options ...
    componentName: 'myProofreadingCard'
  }
]
```

As last step you have to register your own card `myProofreadingCard` in your downstream as an angular component.

```js
angular.module('livingdocs-editor').component('myProofreadingCard', {
  template: require('./my_proofreading_card.html'),
  controller: require('./my_proofreading_controller.js'),
  bindings: {
    documentInfo: '<',
    documentMetadata: '<',
    actions: '<',
    options: '<'
  }
})
```

If you want to have all features available in your own card, you can copy and modify our `liTaskCard` example from the upstream.

For infinite products like an e-paper there is usually a “build” stage involved. With the new Deliveries feature we allow a user to trigger a remote system to kick off a delivery build and report the status of the build back to Livingdocs. This allows an editor to get a better view on the infinite product life cycle. These are the features:

![delivery](./delivery.png)

As soon as the document has been published, the delivery section will show up. Clicking on the build button will trigger the [Webhook]({{< ref "/reference/webhooks" >}}) `document.build` which in turn will trigger the delivery build in the external system, as configured in the Project Config `settings`.
The external build system can report back the current build status with an optional message via public API. The status and an optional message are reflected in the delivery section of the Publish Control, as seen above.

Update the status (from an external system) back to Livingdocs:

`POST /api/v1/documents/360/addDeliveryStatus`

Payload:

```json
{
  "reportId": "2SG2MAA9RwPn",
  "publicationId": 524,
  "deliveryHandle": "mobile",
  "status": "success",
  "message": "More info see <a href=\"https://google.ch\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>"
}
```

See [addDeliveryStatus]({{< ref "/reference/public-api/add-delivery-status" >}}) in the Public API documentation for more information.

## Add Webhooks and Deliveries to your Project Config

Add a Webhook to the Project Config to trigger the external system to build a delivery.

```js
// Project Config
{
  v: 2,
  ...
  webhooks: {
    active: true,
    configurations: [
      {
        handle: 'my-registered-build-endpoint',
        label: '...',
        description: '...',
        url: 'https://example.com/my-webhook-endpoint',
        secret: 'a-secret-token-to-sign-the-request',
        active: true,
        events: [
          {
            // the document.build event will be called when an editor presses the build button
            name: 'document.build',
            conditions: {
              // only call the Webhook when the delivery build called 'web' is triggered
              deliveryHandles: ['web']
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
}

```

Configure the available deliveries for this project and optionally customize the build button labels in the Project Config.

```js
// Project Config
{
  v: 2,
  ...
  deliveries: [
    {
      handle: 'web',
      label: 'Website',
      isPrimary: true,
      icon: 'book-open',
      url: {
        origin: 'https://livingdocs.io',
        pathPattern: '/doc/:id'
      },
      build: {
        enabled: true,
        triggerButtonLabel: 'Build',
        retriggerButtonLabel: 'Build again',
        retryButtonLabel: 'Retry'
      }
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

Configure which data-records have a build button and build status in the publish control.


```js
// Project Config contentTypes
{
  v: 2,
  ...
  documentType: 'data-record',
  deliveries: [
    {
      deliveryName: 'web',
      isPrimary: true
    }
  ]
}

```

## Overview

The routing feature consists of several parts:

1. the *routing configuration*, to design how document paths should look
1. the *path builder*, to generate the path of a document,
1. the *path resolver*, to retrieve document information from a path,
1. the *routes indexer*, responsible for keeping track of paths and
1. the *routes cache*, in which all published documents and some paths are
   stored.

Rough picture/story of how these components/concepts are tied together:

#### `routing.pathPattern.type` is `'article'`

There is a document titled *I'm on the road again!*, its documentId is `173`. It
is has `contentType: interview` in the project `projectId: 5`, in the channel
`channelId: 12`.

For this channel, the `interview` Content Type configuration has the following
`routing` key:

```js
  routing: {
    enabled: true,
    pathPatterns: {
      type: 'article',
      current: '/interview/:YYYY/:MM/:slug--:id'
    }
  }
```

Publishing this document in January 2018, here is what happens in the routing
system:

* the *path builder* will generate the following path:
  `/interview/2018/01/i-m-on-the-road-again--173`
* this path will be stored as part of the Metadata for this Publication
* as for any publication, a publication event is written to the database
* since the `pathPatterns.type` for this Content Type is `article`, the system
  knows that the path contains the `documentId` (`:id`), this will be used to
  extract the `documentId` while resolving path -> document.

Now, the routes indexer sees a new publication event. It first puts the routing
information for this publication (found in the Publication Metadata) in the
*routes cache:*

```js
// key => value
'doc:173' => {
  route: {
    metadata: {
      projectId: 5,
      channelId: 12,
      channelHandle: 'web'
    },
    data: {
      path: '/interview/2018/01/i-m-on-the-road-again--173',
      type: 'document',
      resource: {
        id: 173,
        statusCode: 200
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This KV entry is used by the resolver. When asked to resolve
`/interview/2018/01/i-m-on-the-road-again--173`, the configured `pathPatterns`
are turned into RegExp. For `pathPatterns.type: 'article'`, it allows extracting
the `:id`, here `173`.

Querying the routes cache for `doc:173` very efficiently retrieves the above
data, telling us for instance that the document is still published (`200`). Had
it been unpublished or deleted, we would have respectively `data.type ===
'unpublished'` and `data.statusCode === 410`, or `data.type === 'deleted'` and
`data.statusCode === 410`.

#### `routing.pathPattern.type` is `'page'`

Here is what changes from the previous example if the publication belongs to a
contentType configured with `routing.pathPattern.type: 'page'`:

* `pathPatterns.current` does not need to contain `:id`, the document ID.
* After writing the routing information for this publication in the routes cache
  as described above, the routes indexer adds another entry to the routes cache
  :
    ```js
    // key => value
    'path:5:/page/about' => {
      metadata: {
        projectId: 5,
        channelId: 12,
        channelHandle: 'web'
      },
      data: {
        type: 'document',
        resource: {
          id: 175, // document ID
          statusCode: 200
        }
      }
    }
    ```
* When asked to resolve `/page/about` for `projectId: 5`, since the document ID
  cannot be extracted from the path using RegExp matching, a cache lookup is
  done for `path:5:/page/about` which gives us the document ID (`175`) and its
  status (`200`, published).
    * Should this document get republished with another slug than `about`, e.g.
      `about-us`, the path pattern such as `/page/:slug` would give `/page
      /about-us` instead of `/page/about`. The routes indexer notices the new
      publication and updates the cache `'path:5:/page/about'` replacing `data`
      like this:
        ```js
        data: {
          type: 'redirect',
          path: '/page/about-us',
          resource: {
            statusCode: 301 // HTTP 301 is 'Moved Permanently'
          }
        }
        ```
    * It would also write a new cache entry for `'path:5:/page/about-us'`.


## Configuration

Routing configuration takes place on two levels:

1. Environment: Globally configure a Key-Value (KV) store and the routing
   feature (cache backend, indexer interval, fallback path patterns) and enable
   the routing.
1. Content Type: Enabled and configure how the paths should look like (path
   patterns) for a specific Content Type.

### Environment

In your environment configuration file (e.g. `local.js`), two top-level config
keys are required:

#### KV

Routing data is stored in a Key-Value (KV) store. This store is abstracted by an
 API named **levelup**. See [Routes Cache](#routes-cache) for supported
adapters.

```js
  kv: {
    enabled: true,
    levelUpAdapter: 'redisdown', // (default: memdown)
    redis: {
      host: process.env.redis__host || 'localhost',
      port: process.env.redis__port || 6379
    }
  },
```

#### Routing

```js
  routing: {
    // needs to be explicitly enabled for each contentType
    enabled: true,
    // (optional, only used together with redisdown)
    redis: {
      // (default: 5000) how often do we check if we're the master, in ms
      master_check_interval: 5000
    },
    // (optional)
    indexing: {
      enabled: true,
      debug_routes: false,
      // number of publication events to process in each batch
      batch_size: 500, // (default: 1000)
      // routes cache update interval, in ms
      watch_interval: 1000 // (default: 1000)
    }
  },
```

### Content Type configuration

`type PathPattern = string;`

```js
  metadata: {
    // ... other metadata plugins.
    // a plugin keyed 'routing' is mandatory, `li-routing` is the one we provide
    routing: {plugin: 'li-routing'},
    // A custom plugin, see "Custom Placeholders" section of this document
    mood: {plugin: 'li-test-mood'}
  },
  routing: {
    enabled: boolean,
    pathPatterns: {
      // path to an 'article' needs to have an `:id`, path to a 'page' doesn't
      type: 'article' | 'page',
      // used to build `documentType` paths and to parse article paths
      current: PathPattern,
      // previously used path patterns, used to parse paths if `current` failed
      legacy: PathPattern[]
    }
  }
```

`routing`:
* `.enabled`: unless explicitly set to `true`, routing will not work for this
  Content Type.
* `.pathPatterns`:
  * `.type`: has to be either `article` or `page`. If `type: 'article'`, all
    patterns need to contain at least one occurrence of the `:id` placeholder.
    This makes resolving a path to a document very efficient by extracting the
    document ID directly from the path. If `type: 'page'`, there is no such
    restriction. This allows for nice paths such as `/page/about` but is
    slightly less efficient because resolution is done via a Key-Value store
    lookup.
  * `.current`: a string defining the current path pattern, see examples below.
  * `.legacy`: an array of path patterns that are not used anymore. We keep
    track of them because they can help extract IDs from paths generated with
    patterns no longer in use.

#### Placeholders

A path pattern is a string defining the structure of paths to documents.
Dynamic parts are defined with `:placeholders`.

**Examples**

* `/stories/:YYYY/:slug--:id`
* `/:YYYY/:MM/:DD/:id/:slug`
* `/page/:slug`

A path patterns is used when generating the path to a publication during the
publication process. It is part of what gets written in the Publication Metadata
under the `routing` key. It is also used to resolve some path to the
corresponding document.

**Default path pattern placeholders**

Here is the list of default path pattern placeholders available, together with
their respective RegExp part used while resolving a path:

* `:id` **document ID**, mandatory for `pathPatterns.type: 'article'`

    `[0-9]+`

* `:slug` **title slug**

    `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`

* `:M` **month**: 1 2 ... 11 12

    `1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12`

* `:MM` **month**: 01 02 ... 11 12

    `01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12`

* `:MMM` **month**: jan feb ... nov dec

    `jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec`

* `:MMMM` **month**: january february ... november december

    `january|february|march|april|may|june|july|august|september|october|november|december`

* `:D` **day**: 1 2 ... 30 31

    `1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30|31`

* `:DD` **day**: 01 02 ... 30 31

    `01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30|31`

* `:Y` **year**: 70 71 ... 29 30

    `[0-9]{2}`

* `:YYYY` **year**: 1970 1971 ... 2029 2030

    `[0-9]{4}`

#### Custom Placeholders

You can define your own placeholders if need be. This can be done via Metadata
Plugins. For instance you could create a Metadata Plugin named *section* to
have text field in the Editor screen where you'd enter the section in which to
file this article, e.g. *international* or *sport*.

Using this *section* metadata content as a placeholder named `:section`, you
first need this Metadata Plugin to expose a function
`.getRoutePart(documentVersion) => string`. When building a path for a
publication for which the path pattern contains `:section`, this function will
be passed the [DocumentVersion]({{< ref "/customising/server/document-version.md" >}}) to publish and should return the string with
which `:section` will be replaced in the path.

Take a look at [this example metadata plugin][metadatapluginplaceholder].

This metadata plugin has to set up on the Content Type configuration that has
a path pattern with custom placeholders. The placeholder exact name will be
the key used to define the plugin.

**Example Content Type config** with a custom placeholder
`:configuredpluginname` and its corresponding configured plugin. To replace
`:configuredpluginname`, the `getRoutePart` function in `li-some-plugin.js`
will be used.

```js
  metadata: {
    ...,
    // ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓  ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
    configuredpluginname: {
      plugin: 'li-some-plugin'
    }
  },
  routing: {
    enabled: true,
    pathPatterns: {
      type: 'article',
      current: '/:YYYY/:MM/:DD/:configuredpluginname/:slug--:id',
      // custom placeholder     ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑  ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ matching above metadata key
      legacy: [
        '/article/:slug--:id'
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Routes Indexer

The *routes indexer* is a procedure running at a configurable interval. It runs
at most once per interval duration (i.e. if one iteration takes longer than the
interval, the next iteration will only start as soon as the previous one is
done, they cannot overlap).

The *routes indexer* watches the publication events, polling the database for
events that happened after the last indexed event, `lastIndexedEvent` being a
special key in the *routes cache* used to store indexing progress.

#### Start Up, Warm Up

When the server starts, if the *routes cache* is empty, the interval will be set
to zero and the server will index all existing publication events as fast as it
can.

Since the *routes cache* has `lastIndexedEvent` key, if the server reboots and
the *routes cache* backend in use is persisted somewhere, the *routes indexer*
will pick up where it left off instead of reindexing everything from the
beginning.

### Routes Cache

The *routes cache* is a key-value store interfaced using a leveldb-compatible
API provided by [*levelup*][levelup]. It can be backed by any compatible engine.
A few options include:

* [*memdown*][memdown], an in-memory KV store - we use it in our tests since we
  don't care about persisting the cache
* [*redisdown*][redisdown], which is a Redis backend - use this for production

The *routes cache* has two keys per once-published document (i.e. not per
publication but rather per document for which we got at least one publication
event).

1. A key associating a document `id` (keyed as `doc:<documentId>`) to some
   metadata about the corresponding document, most importantly its state
   (published, unpublished) and the metadata routing data, and
1. A key associating a path (keyed as `path:<projectId>:<path>`) to roughly an
   API response.

#### Master check

In a setting with more than one Livingdocs server running against the same
*routes cache*, we want to have at most one *routes indexer* running at any
time. Having many of them trying to concurrently index the same publication
events could create race conditions.

When using Redis, a Livingdocs server will either be the *master* and index the
routes by running the *routes indexer* or not be the *master* and not index the
routes by pausing the *routes indexer*.

When a *master* crashes or gets shut down, another node will get promoted
*master*. Same goes when *master* gets too slow because of the load or any other
issue: it will get demoted and another node will get promoted.

`routing:redis:master_check_interval` is the interval at which a process checks
whether they are master or not, and should or should not get demoted or
promoted.

#### Generating routing info for existing publications

Any document published prior to enabling routing for their Content Type will not
possess any metadata routing info, therefore the indexer will not be able to
take them into account.

If you already have published documents but their metadata don't have routing
infos because the plugin wasn't there when they were published, the easiest fix
is to republish these documents. No need to delete them and recreate them,
republishing is enough to get the metadata up to date.

### Resolver API

#### `resolveFromPath`

Resolving strategy is:

1. attempt `documentId` extraction using the parsers built with
   `pathPatterns.current` from contentTypes that have
   `pathPattern.type === 'article'`
1. attempt `documentId` extraction using the parsers built with
   `pathPatterns.legacy` from contentTypes that have
   `pathPattern.type === 'article'`
1. attempt `documentId` extraction using the parsers built with
   `pathPatterns.current` from contentTypes that have
   `pathPattern.type === 'page'`
1. attempt `documentId` extraction using the parsers built with
   `pathPatterns.legacy` from contentTypes that have
   `pathPattern.type === 'page'`
1. do a KV lookup with the path
1. give up and return an error (404)

```js
/**
 * @function fromPath Resolves a path to a publicationStatus
 * @param obj: { projectId: number, channelId: number, path: string }
 * @param callback: (err: Error | number | null, value: PublicationStatus | null): void
 */
resolveFromPath({projectId, channelId, path}, callback)
```

#### `resolveDocumentId`

 */
resolveFromDocumentId({projectId, channelId, documentId}, callback)
```

#### `resolveDocumentIds`

```js
/**
 * @function fromDocumentIds Gets publication status from document IDs
 * @param obj: { projectId: number, channelId: number, documentIds: number[] }
 * @param callback: (err: Error | number | null, value: PublicationStatus | null): void
 */
resolveFromDocumentIds({projectId, channelId, documentIds}, callback)

title: Media Library
description: In-depth guide to the media library

---

Livingdocs contains a Media Library that solves management and delivery of Images and Videos.
There are different pieces that can be used to cover custom needs per project.

This guide will walk you through setting up a basic Media Library for your project with Images and Videos support, you will learn about some details along the way.

At heart, the Media Library is based around configured `Media Types`. You might be familiar already with the concept of `Content Types`. `Media Types` are very similar.
You can configure as many different `Media Types` as you want. Usually you want to have at least 1 for Images (in fact, if you don't define one yourself, there is one added automatically at runtime).

See the [mediaType reference]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/media-types.md" >}}) for a full reference of the `mediaType` configuration options.

When you have configured mediaTypes, you will get buttons to let users insert `Images` and `Videos` from the Document Editing Toolbar automatically.
![Editing Toolbar](editing-toolbar.png)

The [Main Navigation]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/editor-settings#main-navigation" >}}) will automatically hold entries for `Images` and `Videos` as well if you have a `liItem: 'mediaLibrary'` entry in your `mainNavigation` config.

## Images

### Server Config
First, you need to make sure your Media Library can [store images]({{< ref "/customising/server-configuration#media-library-dam" >}}).

### Image Services
To render images in documents, Livingdocs uses so called [Image Services]({{< ref "/guides/media-library/image-services.md" >}}). You need to [configure one in your project]({{< ref "/guides/media-library/image-services.md#configuring-an-image-service" >}}) to make use of images in documents.

### Basic Media Type
Let's setup a `mediaType` for the images first. You add it to your [project config]({{< ref "/reference/project-config" >}}) in an array at the top-level property `mediaTypes`.

```js
//media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'image', // one mediaImage must have the handle 'image', additional ones can be named as you like
  type: 'mediaImage',
  info: {
    label: 'Images', // used in dashboards generated for this mediaType
    description: ''
  },
  metadata: [ // any metadata configuration as you know it from contentTypes already
    {
      handle: 'title',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true, // if a metadata property is required, the user will see a form to enter the metadata during upload
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a title',
        maxLength: 200,
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'description',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'credit',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true,
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a source',
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'namedCrops',
      type: 'li-named-crops',
      config: {
        index: true,
        namedCrops: [
          {
            name: 'mobile',
            isOptional: true
          },
          {
            name: 'desktop'
          }
        ]
      },
      ui: {
        label: 'Named Crops',
        component: 'liMetaNamedCropsForm'
      }
    }
  ],
  editor: {
    // the dashboard seen by users when opening Images/Videos from the document editor
    dashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {
          filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'
        }
      ]
    },
    // the dashboard opened through the main navigation
    managementDashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {
          filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### IPTC extraction
Since many image files (especially those you get from image agencies) hold metadata defined by the IPTC standard, you want to configure extraction for certain metadata fields, so your users don't have to manually type them.
You do this by adding the `exifExtraction` property to the `mediaType`. See [the list of all IPTC fields]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/media-types.md#exif-extraction" >}}) and how to configure them.

The exif extraction will run when an image is imported through the [Import API]({{< ref "/customising/advanced/import-api.md" >}}) or when a user uploads an image through the UI.
The user has the chance to manually change the extracted Metadata before the image is actually stored in the Media Library.

```js
// media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'image',
  type: 'mediaImage',
  exifExtraction: {
    mappings: [
      {field: 'Title', metadataPropertyName: 'title'},
      {field: 'Description', metadataPropertyName: 'description'},
      {field: 'Credit Line', metadataPropertyName: 'credit'}
    ]
  },
}
```

### Named Crops
With Livingocs, you can manage multiple crops per Image. We call it `Named Crops` and it works like this:
- You can define the crops hold with an image in the Media Library
- A user can edit these crops during upload or from within the Media Library Management Dashboard
- Whenever an image is used in a document, the crops are copied into the document and can be changed locally within the document

There are different strategies how to configure the crops:

1. Configure Named Crops with names after the usage, e.g. `desktop`, `mobile`
2. Configure Named Crops with aspect ratio names, e.g. `16:9`, `4:3`


We are going to configure strategy 1 in this guide. There are 4 points where we need to configure this:

1. designSettings
2. mediaType
3. Design: image components `doc-image` directive
4. Metadata: `li-image` metadata properties (for a teaser image for example)

#### designSettings
In the [designSettings]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/design-settings" >}}) of the project config, all the `namedCrops` need to be configured. You can then use all or some of them in `mediaType`s and `doc-image` directives.

```js
projectConfig.designSettings: {
  //...
  namedCrops: [
    {
      handle: 'mobile',
      label: 'Mobile',
      description: 'this image will be shown on small screens',
      // on small screens, having exact same ratios across all images is not that important
      // we let the user pick one but change freely
      recommendedRatios: ['1:1', '16:9']
    },
    {
      handle: 'desktop',
      label: 'Desktop',
      description: 'this image will be shown on wide screens',
      // for large screens, we want consistent 16:9 image ratios, the user can't change that
      imageRatios: ['16:9']
    },
    {
      handle: 'sm-teaser',
      label: 'SM Teaser',
      description: 'this image will be shown on wide screens',
      // for social media, we might want to use a different crop, but the ratio is fixed
      imageRatios: ['16:9']
    }
  ],
  //...
}
```

#### mediaType
In order to hold default crops on images in the Media Library we configure the special purpose metadata plugin `li-named-crops`. It allows users to set crops during image upload and later on within the Media Library.
These default crops will be copied into documents at the time an image is inserted into a document (well, a `doc-image` directive technically). They are copied so a user can change the crops locally for this specific usage of the image. Later changes to the crops in the Media Library won't affect the usages in `doc-image` anymore.

To define which default crops to store in the Media Library, we configure a metadata property of type `li-named-crops` within the metadata config of a `mediaType` of type `mediaImage`.

```js
// media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'image',
  type: 'mediaImage',
  // ...
  metadata: [
    // ...
    {
      handle: 'namedCrops',
      type: 'li-named-crops',
      config: {
        // configure all the namedCrops defined in the designSettings
        // that you want to keep a default within every mediaLibrary image for
        namedCrops: [
          {
            // the mobile crop is optional, the user can add it at will
            name: 'mobile', // name references the handle of a namedCrop in the designSettings
            isOptional: true
          },
          {
            // the desktop crop will always be defined after upload
            // the user can't remove it but only change according to the
            // configuration in the designSettings
            name: 'desktop'
          },
          {
            name: 'sm-teaser',
            isOptional: true
          }
        ]
      },
      ui: {
        label: 'Named Crops',
        component: 'liMetaNamedCropsForm'
      }
    }
  ],
  // ...
}
```

#### doc-image directive
Now we need to configure the `namedCrops` on the [doc-image]({{< ref "/reference/document/document-design/directives/image.md" >}}) directive of our image component in the [design]({{< ref "/reference/document/document-design" >}}).

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'image',
  label: 'Image',
  iconUrl: `https://livingdocs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/magazine-design/assets/images/icons-components/icon_image.svg`,
  directives: [
    {
      name: 'image',
      type: 'image',
      // for images in documents, only the desktop and mobile namedCrops
      // are used, the desktop is the default (shown in the document)
      // the mobile crop can be added by a user at will
      namedCrops: [
        // the name references the handle of a namedCrop in the designSettings
        {name: 'desktop', isDefault: true},
        {name: 'mobile', isOptional: true}
      ]
    }
  ],
  html: dedent`
    <div class="m-asset-image m-asset-image--numbered">
      <div class="m-asset-image__image">
        <img class="responsive-img" doc-image="image">
      </div>
      <div class="m-asset-image__options">
        <div class="a-asset-input" doc-editable="caption">Caption</div>
        <div class="a-asset-input" doc-editable="source">Source</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  `
}
```

#### Metadata li-image
Last but not least, we configure the namedCrops on our teaserImage components. In this example, there are two teasers, one used internally called `Teaser Image` and one for social media shares called `Social Media Teaser Image`. We are going to configure both. This goes into the metadata configuration of a [contentType]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types.md" >}}).

```js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'regular',
  documentType: 'article',
  // ...
  metadata: [
    // ...
    {
      handle: 'teaserImage',
      type: 'li-image',
      config: {
        namedCrops: [
          {name: 'desktop', isDefault: true},
          {name: 'mobile', isOptional: true}
        ]
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaImageForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'socialMediaTeaserImage',
      type: 'li-image',
      config: {
        namedCrops: [
          {name: 'socialMediaTeaser', isDefault: true}
        ]
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaImageForm'}
    }
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```

### Focal Point Cropping

With `release-2022-11` focal point cropping was introduced.

Focal point selection is supported on [`li-named-crops`](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/metadata-plugin-list/#li-named-crops) and [`li-image`](https://docs.livingdocs.io/reference/document/metadata/metadata-plugin-list/#li-image) whenever multiple crops are present.


#### Where automatic cropping struggles
Each crop starts with an automatic crop, choosing the default aspect ratio. This does not always lead to ideal results.

This image of a chapel in front of the famous Matterhorn in the swiss alps is a good example where automatic crops would normally struggle.

The _Mobile_ crop defines an upright aspect ratio of 3:4. By default, the 3:4 crop is centered within the original image.
But in this case, it cuts off both subjects.
![Screenshot showing default cropping cuts off main subjects](fp_crop_default.png)

#### Focal Point Mode

With the cropping tool opened, click on _Set Focal Point_ to go into focal point selection mode.
In this mode, all possible crops are showing a live preview on the right side, also those that where not yet added in the previous view.
On the left side, the original image is shown with slightly faded colors and a circle indicating the current focal point position.

By default, the focal point is the center of the image. This is also true if the focal point is not defined at all.
![Screenshot showing the focal point in the center of the image](fp_select_center.png)

#### Changing the Focal Point

Let's say we'd like the _Matterhorn_ to be our main subject in this image.
While in focal point mode, click on the subject inside the left image to update the focal point.
Notice how the previews on the right side are updated. The 3:4 _Mobile_ crop looks a lot better now.
![Screenshot showing the focal point on the Matterhorn](fp_select_mountain.png)

We changed our mind and we'd like to put the focal point on the nice chapel.
Just click on it and observe how the previews are changing.
For best results, use the previews to fine-tune the focal point by making slight adjustments.

![Screenshot showing the focal point on the chapel](fp_select_chapel.png)

#### Apply the Focal Point

Once you're happy with the previews, click on _Apply Focal Point_.
This will bring you back to the normal crop view.

**Hint**: After you've made changes to the focal point, don't forget to click on _Save_.
When clicking on cancel or closing the window without saving, focal point changes are lost.

#### Backwards Compatibility

Focal point cropping is fully backwards compatible and does not need or have any configuration.

Images can now have a `focalPoint` property with `x` and `y` coordinates.
However, each image starts with no focal point defined.

It will only be set if a user explicitly selected a focal point.
In all other cases, the automatic crop calculation falls back to the center crop as it was before `release_2022-11`.

## Videos
Since `release-2021-03` you can manage your Videos with the Livingdocs Media Library as well. It works pretty similar to the images. The solution still has some shortcomings you need to be aware of:

- No render strategies or video services like you know them from images are available yet. That means the system works well if you render from the JSON in the delivery, but not so well if you let Livingdocs do the rendering to HTML.
- As with images, you don't want to deliver the original Video file to your customers directly but have some kind of transcoding to different formats and sizes. There is no integrated solution to this in Livingdocs yet.

Nevertheless if you find solutions to these problems outside of Livingdocs, you can very well make use of the Video Management System already.

### Server Config

You need to make sure your Media Library can [store videos]({{< ref "/customising/server-configuration#media-library-dam" >}}).

### Basic Media Type
Let's setup a `mediaType` for the videos. You add it to your [project config]({{< ref "/reference/project-config" >}}) in an array at the top-level property `mediaTypes`.

```js
//media-types/video.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'video', // one mediaVideo must have the handle 'video', additional ones can be named as you like
  type: 'mediaVideo',
  info: {
    label: 'Videos', // used in dashboards generated for this mediaType
    description: ''
  },
  metadata: [ // any metadata configuration as you know it from contentTypes already
    {
      handle: 'title',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true, // if a metadata property is required, the user will see a form to enter the metadata during upload
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a title',
        maxLength: 200,
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'description',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'credit',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true,
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a source',
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    }
  ],
  editor: {
    // the dashboard seen by users when opening Images/Videos from the document editor
    dashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'}
      ]
    },
    // the dashboard opened through the main navigation
    managementDashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Poster Image
For Videos, you want to have a poster image displayed in your Video Player before the Video starts playing. Livingdocs provides a metadata plugin to manage this image.

When configured, a UI to manage the image is provided.
![poster image](poster-image.png)

You can even select a specific frame of the video by pausing the player and selecting the current frame as the poster image.
![poster image frame selection](poster-image-frame-selection.png)

Images stored with this metadata plugin will contain one crop in the aspect ratio of the video file automatically. A user can change the zoom and position but not the aspect ratio of that crop.

Poster Images are stored withing the Media Library as images when uploaded through the poster image metadata plugin or a frame of the video is selected. You probably want to configure a separate `mediaType` for these, since there are different requirements to the metadata.

#### mediaType for the images
Don't forget to add this the the `mediaTypes` in your [project config]({{< ref "/reference/project-config" >}}).

```js
// /media-types/poster-image.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'posterImage',
  type: 'mediaImage',
  info: {
    label: 'Poster Images'
  },
  hidden: true, // This makes sure these images are not shown in the regular Image Library
  metadata: [
    {
      handle: 'title',
      type: 'li-text',
      ui: {
        component: 'liMetaTextForm'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### li-poster-image metadata plugin
Now you can add the `li-poster-image` metadata plugin to your video `mediaType`:

```js
//media-types/video.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'video',
  type: 'mediaVideo',
  // ...
  metadata: [
    // ...
    {
      handle: 'posterImage',
      type: 'li-poster-image',
      ui: {
        component: 'liMetaPosterImageForm',
        config: {
          uploadMediaType: 'posterImage' // this is the handle of the mediaType used for uploaded images
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  // ...
}
```


### External Transcoding Service

A Transcoding Service can be used to convert a Video into different formats and resolutions.
Livingdocs lets you connect to an external Transcoding Service using a metadata plugin that
manages the transcoding state.

When configured, the transcoding state of a Video is shown in the UI.

Initial state:
![Initial transcoding state](transcoding-state-zero.png)

After transcoding:
![Final transcoding state](transcoding-state-done.png)

#### li-transcoding-state metadata plugin
Add the `li-transcoding-state` metadata plugin to your video `mediaType`:

```js
//media-types/video.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'video',
  type: 'mediaVideo',
  // ...
  metadata: [
    // ...
    {
      handle: 'transcoding',
      type: 'li-transcoding-state'
    }
  ],
  // ...
}
```

#### Transcoding Service implementation
An external transcoding service can be connected to Livingdocs as follows:
- Use [webhooks]({{< ref "/reference/webhooks" >}}) to get notified about transcoding requests.
- Use the public API (mediaLibrary GET) to fetch information about a transcoding request.
- Use the public API (mediaLibrary PATCH) to update the transcoding state.

This data structure is used to track transcoding state:
```js
{
  "metadata": {
    "transcoding": {
      "commands": [{
        "assetKey": "de2bc74bea-3",
        "commandId": "1980b544cfc2",
        "createdAt": "2021-03-01T12:34:56Z",

        // One of ["requested", "acknowledged", "inProgress",
        //         "done", "error"]
        "state": "inProgress",

        // optional, 0 - 100
        "progress": 42,

        // optional
        "errorMessage": "Error: Unsupported video resolution."
      }],
      "transcodings": [{
        "assetKey": "de2bc74bea-3",

        // Just an example; defined by external system
        "versions": [{
          "format": "video/mp4",
          "url": "https://example.com/example-w500.mp4",
          "size": "mobile"
        },
        {
          "format": "video/webm",
          "url": "https://example.com/example-w500.webm",
          "size": "mobile"
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

Transcoding happens in the following sequence:
- When a user clicks "Start processing", a new `command` with `state: "requested"` is created.
- The transcoding service gets notified via webhook and can report transcoding progress by setting `state` and `progress` / `errorMessage`.
- When transcoding is done, the transcoding service is expected to set `state` to `done` and add an entry to the `transcodings` array.


## Files

Since `release-2021-06` you can manage other files than videos and images with the Livingdocs Media Library as well.

### Server Config

You need to make sure your Media Library can [store files]({{< ref "/customising/server-configuration#media-library-dam" >}}).

### Basic Media Type
Let's setup a `mediaType` for the files. You add it to your [project config]({{< ref "/reference/project-config" >}}) in an array at the top-level property `mediaTypes`.

```js
//media-types/file.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'file', // one mediaFile must have the handle 'file', additional ones can be named as you like
  type: 'mediaFile',
  info: {
    label: 'Files', // used in dashboards generated for this mediaType
    description: ''
  },
  // any metadata configuration as you know it from contentTypes already
  metadata: [
    {
      handle: 'title',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true, // if a metadata property is required, the user will see a form to enter the metadata during upload
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a title',
        maxLength: 200,
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'description',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    },
    {
      handle: 'credit',
      type: 'li-text',
      config: {
        required: true,
        requiredErrorMessage: 'Please provide a source',
        index: true
      },
      ui: {component: 'liMetaTextForm'}
    }
  ],
  editor: {
    // the dashboard seen by users when opening from the document editor
    dashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'}
      ]
    },
    // the dashboard opened through the main navigation
    managementDashboard: {
      displayFilters: [
        {filterName: 'liDateTimeRange'}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Metadata Translations
The Media Library supports metadata translations since `release-2021-06`. Here you learn how to configure it.

First, you have to configure the available languages in the system as [described here]({{< ref "/guides/editor/multi-language.md" >}})

### Add Plugin to Enable Translations

As a next step, you have to add the `li-metadata-translations` metadata plugin to enable the Translations behavior for the media library.

```js
//media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  metadata: [
    {
      handle: 'language',
      type: 'li-metadata-translations',
      ui: {
        component: 'liMetaSelectForm',
        service: 'languageSelection'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Translatable metadata properties
Now you can configure any metadata property in a `mediaType` to be translatable by the user like this:

```js
//media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  metadata: [
    {
      config: {
        translatable: true
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

### Translatable assets (image/video/file)
If you want to allow users to define different assets per language on a Media Library entry, you have to specifically allow this per `mediaType` like this:
```js
//media-types/image.js
module.exports = {
  handle: 'image',
  type: 'mediaImage'
  // ...
  asset: {
    // this allows to set another asset per translation once
    translatable: true,
    // this allows for existing assets to be changed by the user
    replaceable: true
  },
  //...
}
```

#### Caveats
- With `release-2021-06`, using `li-named-crops` metadata plugin on `mediaImage` types in combination with asset translation has some suboptimal behaviors. This will be improved in a next release.
- Both `translatable` and `replaceable` might need handling in your delivery regarding caching, fallback resolution when rendering different languages etc. You need to be aware of this and find solutions. Setting these assets triggers a `mediaLibraryEntry.update` event on the Events API and the webhooks in the same way as updating the metadata does.

# Why
With Livingdocs, we continuously improve our product with releases every other month instead of a big new version every couple of years. Through that, we sometimes have better answers to a specific problem over time and phase out some features.

# What
With some smaller changes, phasing out is more straightforward, and we directly enter a 3-release deprecation phase. With other features, we understand it takes more time to move to another solution. Therefore we keep them in maintenance mode to make sure everyone has ample time to move off the feature before starting the deprecation phase.

When a feature is in maintenance mode, it won't get any functionality updates anymore. Livingdocs will fix bugs and help you with moving off the feature.

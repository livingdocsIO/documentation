title: Livingdocs Enterprise Documentation

This is the technical documentation for the "Livingdocs CMS - Enterprise Edition". As a starting point we recommend the [Evaluation Guide]({{< ref "./evaluation/getting-started.md" >}}) and then moving on from there.
Make sure that you have the Livingdocs Boilerplate projects ([editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor-boilerplate), [server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate)) cloned locally as the documentation refers to them in many places.

## Service Documentation

If you are a service customer and do not have access to our source code, refer to our [Service Documentation](https://developers.livingdocs.io). This documentation only covers the Enterprise Edition of Livingdocs.


## Installation

If you use Livingdocs as an on-premises software you will have access to the (private) boilerplates projects and/or an .npmrc file with access to our core repositories (Note: this requires at least signing an evaluation contract, if you haven't done so already contact us at contact@livingdocs.io).
To start an evaluation you can go through [our evaluation guide]({{< ref "evaluation/getting-started.md" >}}).

To get a devops environment, refer to our [devops section]({{< ref "operations/self-hosting.md" >}}).

## Global `.gitignore`

Every developer has their own tools and preferences. If you want to ignore some
files that are located inside a repository that are created by your tools and
preferences and not specific to that project (e.g. Mac OS X `.DS_Store` files or
editor specific files such as `*.sublime-project`) you should use a global
`.gitignore` file.

See [GitHub's help page][global gitignore] on how to configure git to use such
a global `.gitignore` file.

# Livingdocs Documentation


## Local Setup

This documentation is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

You can run it locally:
```bash
# install hugo
brew install hugo

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the hugo dev server
npm start
```

When working with the lunr search code it can be useful to test the real production setup, due to the way we edit the search index for production:

```bash
# build the static site into `./public`
npm run build
# or the uncompressed version
npm run build:fast

# serve the `./public` directory
npm run start:production
```

When editing code you can run `npm run build:fast` in a separate terminal and then refresh the page to see the latest changes. This only takes 1-2 seconds.

## Contribution Guide

### Titles and Subtitles

Always start with `h2` titles in your documents (`h1` should only be used by templates for the page title). Then use `h3` for subtitles.

Check your titles by reading the table of contents generated on the right side of the screen. The titles should make it clear what is to be expected in a section. E.g. avoid generic titles like 'Example'.

### Text

Always be brief and concise. Don't state opinions or use unnecessary adjectives. Or as Einstein puts it «as simple as possible but no simpler».

In the guides always state what a certain guide is trying to achieve. Be comprehensive, i.e. don't leave out stuff that would frustrate people following your guide.


### Images

Images shouldn't be too high. Try to capture images with a 4/3 or similar ratio.

### Screenshots

If you need to take a screenshot of a whole browser, either try to capture just the content without frame or just the specific window.

On a mac, press `CMD+Shift+4` to capture a specific section on the screen.
If you press `Shift` once if the screenshot tool is still open, you can capture a whole window.

### Terminal

Please try to capture a nice segment. If possible try to embed the text in a text code block or use [this website to generate an image](https://carbon.now.sh/?bg=rgba%280%2C0%2C0%2C0%29&t=lucario&wt=bw&l=auto&ds=false&dsyoff=20px&dsblur=68px&wc=false&wa=true&pv=56px&ph=56px&ln=true&fl=1&fm=Fira+Code&fs=14px&lh=152%25&si=false&es=2x&wm=false&code=const%2520cars%2520%253D%2520%255B%27BMW%27%252C%2520%27Volvo%27%252C%2520%27Mini%27%255D%250A%250Afor%2520%28const%2520car%2520of%2520cars%29%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520console.log%28%2560car%253A%2520%2524%257Bcar%257D%2560%29%250A%257D).

# Livingdocs documentation

This is the technical documentation for the Livingdocs CMS. We address 3 larger audiences here:
- designers
- integrators
- core developers

## Livingdocs as a service

You can use our hosted Livingdocs at [edit.livingdocs.io](http://edit.livingdocs.io) and do your integration using our API. This is a headless CMS approach. You can get started immediately by just creating an account on livingdocs.io
Refer to our [API documentation](https://edit.livingdocs.io/public-api.html#/public-api.html) for more information on the available endpoints.
Most of this documentation assumes that you integrate Livingdocs on-premises or have otherwise access to the source code.

## Livingdocs on-premises

If you use Livingdocs as an on-premises software you will have access to the (private) boilerplates projects and/or an .npmrc file with access to our core repositories (Note: this requires at least signing an evaluation contract, if you haven't done so already contact us at contact@livingdocs.io).
To start an evaluation you can go through [our evaluation guide](walkthroughs/evaluation_guide.md).

To get a devops environment, refer to our [devops section](setup-and-deployment/self-hosting.md).

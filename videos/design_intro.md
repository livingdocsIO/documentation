## Abstract

This screencast showcases how to create a Livingdocs Design given that you have already written the HTML and CSS for your intended website. The video touches quite a lot of \(advanced\) topics, so to get a basic idea of what a Livingdocs Design is, we recommend a visit to our [written design documentation](../evaluation-guide/create_designs.md) before watching this screencast.

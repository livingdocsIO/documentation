### Abstract

This screencast showcases how to create a Livingdocs Design given that you have already written the HTML and CSS for your intended website.
The video touches quite a lot of (advanced) topics, so to get a basic idea of what a Livingdocs Design is, we recommend a visit to our
[written design documentation](../reference-docs/common-designs/create_designs.md) before watching this screencast.

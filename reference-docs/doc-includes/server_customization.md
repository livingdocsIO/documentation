## Doc-include server customizations

This section explains how you setup the server to render `doc-include`s and gives an exhaustive listing of all options. It does not explain how to create custom editor user interfaces, this will be explained [here](./editor_customization.md).

### Resolve options

Includes can be resolved in two modes when rendering (i.e. publishing) a document. Either a `<ld-include>` tag can be rendered so the include can be resolved outside of Livingdocs (e.g. in a microservice). Or the includes can be resolved on the Livingdocs server in the rendering of the document.

#### Unresolved include

An unresolved include looks like this in the published document's HTML:
```html
<div>
  <ld-include data-include-service="embed-teaser" data-include-params="{&quot;mediaId&quot;:2}"></ld-include>
</div>
```

It contains all the information needed to replace it with the actual content. The example shows the core include for the [embed-teaser](./embed_and_list.md#embed-teaser) that is given the linked document id as a parameter.

#### Resolved include

If the include is resolved instead of the `<ld-include>` you see the actual HTML returned by the include renderer:
```html
<div>
  <a internal href="/articles/2.html">
    <div style="background-image: url(https://image.jpg)"></div>
    <div class="teaser__text">
        <h3><span>Mathieu Pavageau</span> <span> on Wed May 25 2016</span></h3>
      <h2>Rocket</h2>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
```

#### How to configure the rendering option

Includes are not resolved by default. Enable it in the [channel configuration](../server-configuration/channel-config.md):

```js
module.exports = {

  renditions: {
    'web': {
      output: {
        'html': {
          outputRenderer: new CheerioHtml(),
          resolveIncludes: ['embed-teaser']
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `resolveIncludes` array lists all includes that should be resolved inside of Livingdocs. You can configure this by channel and by rendition.

### Registration of an include renderer in the server

You can register an include renderer in the Livingdocs Server using the API of the `li-includes` feature.

The include is rendered for two cases:

- in the editor while editing (WYSIWYG)
- in the rendered (published) HTML if you choose to resolve the include while rendering

So in order to see a preview while editing you have to register an include renderer even if you choose not to resolve includes while rendering.

#### Register an include in the server:

Let's register an include renderer for the core include `embed-teaser`. Since article embeds are very common you will very likely need to do this too.

```js
const includesApi = liServer.features.api('li-includes')

await includesApi.registerService([
  // registers the include rendering service
  require('./plugins/includes/embed-teaser.js')
  require('./plugins/includes/twitter.js')
])
```

`plugins/includes/embed-teaser.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'embed-teaser',
  // The ui configuration is used to configure the user interface
  // in the editor. For the core include `embed-teaser` the UI
  // components already exist
  uiComponents: [{
    type: 'angular-modal',
    sidebarLabel: 'Assign Teaser to content block',
    sidebarButton: 'Link Article',
    modalTitle: 'Article Search',
    modalContentComponent: 'liEmbedTeaserIncludeModal'
  }, {
    type: 'angular-component',
    sidebarLabel: ' ',
    sidebarContentComponent: 'liEmbedTeaserLink'
  }],
  rendering: {
    type: 'function',
    function: function (params, options, callback) {
      // When options preview is true the request comes from a livingdocs
      // editor while a user is editing a document.
      const isPreview = options && options.preview === true

      // It does not render an unpublished document on the public API
      if (isPreview && paramsAreInsufficient(params)) {
        // Return undefined if not enough params are provided to
        // render the include. While editing the draft in the editor
        // this will just leave the include preview visible.
        return callback(null, undefined)
      } else if (shouldNotBeRendered(params)) {
        // Return an empty string to render nothing.
        // While editing the draft in the editor this will remove
        // the include preview.
        return callback(null, {html: ''})
      } else {
        // Render the include
        const html = renderInclude(params)
        return callback(null, {
          html,
          // optionally you can also pass dependencies either as raw code or from a source
          // dependencies: {
          //   css: [{src: 'http://cdn.cloudflare.com/...'}],
          //   js: [
          //     {
          //       src: 'https://instagram.com/embed.js',
          //       namespace: 'includes.instagram'
          //     },
          //     {
          //      code: ... your js script
          //     }
          //   ]
          // }
        })
      }
    })
  }
}
```

### Include UI options

The `uiComponents` array allows you to define a list of ui elements that are rendered in the sidebar upon selection of the `doc-include` (top to bottom). There are 3 supported types:
1. `angular-component`, sidebar user interface
2. `angular-modal`, user interface in a modal dialog (if more space is required), button in the sidebar to open the modal
3. `iframe-modal`, as above user interface in a modal dialog but loaded as an iframe (e.g. if you want to implement your UI outside of Livingdocs)

The first two require an angular plugin to be present in the Livingdocs editor.
The markup for `angular-component` looks as follows:
```js
{
  // required, fixed name
  type: 'angular-component',
  // required, displayed as a label in the sidebar
  sidebarLabel: 'Foo Bar',
  // required, the custom angular component to be rendered in the sidebar
  // this custom component has to be registered in the editor and
  // names must match
  sidebarContentComponent: 'liFoo'
}
```

The angular component `liFoo` is required to be registered in the editor. We explain [here](./editor_customization.md) how to do this.

The markup for `angular-modal` looks as follows:
```js
{
  // required, fixed name
  type: 'angular-modal',
  // required, displayed as a label in the sidebar
  sidebarLabel: 'Assign Teaser to content block',
  // required, text for the button that opens the modal dialog
  sidebarButton: 'Link Article',
  // required, title in the modal dialog
  modalTitle: 'Article Search',
  // required, the custom angular component to be rendered in the modal dialog
  // this custom component has to be registered in the editor and
  // names must match
  modalContentComponent: 'liFooModal'
}
```

Again, the angular component `liFooModal` is required to be registered in the editor.

The markup for `iframe-modal` looks as follows:
```js
{
  // required, fixed name
  type: 'iframe-modal',
  // required, displayed as a label in the sidebar
  sidebarLabel: 'Embed Q graphic',
  // required, text for the button that opens the modal dialog
  sidebarButton: 'Search graphic'
  // required, title in the modal dialog
  modalTitle: 'Q Graphics',
  // required, the url to the iframe that implements the user interface
  // note this user interface is independent of Livingdocs and can be
  // implemented in any language/framework, e.g. react.js
  modalContentUrl: 'https://q.st-staging.nzz.ch/livingdocs-component.html'
}
```

The iframe modal enables you to implement the user interface in a third-party system or re-use existing interfaces.

### Include rendering options

The `rendering` configuration allows you to define how your `doc-include` is rendered. So far we have only seen local methods. The options available are:
1. `function`
2. `remote`

The `function` option is what we have seen so far. You are required to implement a method that renders an HTML string for the `doc-include` in question. Above we have shown several examples for this. The API of the function is:
```
function (params, options, callback)
```

- `params` contains any parameters that the editor user interfaces set plus the `defaultParams` from the design definition, those are the parameters specific to the `doc-include` service
- `options` contains only one entry `preview` that if set to `true` tells you that you are rendering for the editor preview and if `false` for the published document
- `callback` is a method you have to call with your rendered HTML string. The HTML string is the second parameter. The first parameter is `null` on success and an error object if you want to report an error.

The `remote` option allows you to render your HTML in a third-party system that is not Livingdocs.

```js
{
  name: 'q-embed',
  uiComponents: [],
  rendering: {
    type: 'remote',
    url: 'https://q-server.st-staging.nzz.ch/livingdocs-preview/nzz_ch'
  }
}
```

The above example tells the Livingdocs rendering engine that whenever it sees a `doc-include` with service `q-embed` it should do a GET request to the remote URL defined to get the rendered HTML string.

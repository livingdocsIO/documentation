# HTML

HTML directives allow you to insert arbitrary HTML within the tag on which the directive is specified. The idiomatic use case is the free-html component. But you can also use embeds that have predefined validators and only allow specific "whitelisted" HTML to be inserted.

## Example

Example:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  "name": "tweet",
  "label": "Tweet",
  "html": dedent``
  <div class="embed-container">
    <div doc-html="tweet">
        <div class="embed tweet">
        <div class="placeholder"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  `
}
```

## Config Options

There are no config options.
The automatic validation is hardcoded for a set of given embeds and is recognized by the name of the directive:
- `free-html` -> no validation
- `iframe` -> only allow iframe embeds
- `tweet` -> only allow twitter embeds

Use of the client-side embeds (html directive) is not recommended. We advise you to use [includes](./inlude.md) and write your own micro-service to control the rendering of third-party embeds.

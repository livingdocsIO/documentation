# Navigation

You can define the way the main navigation will be triggered. It can be triggered by `clicking`, `hovering` or both. The default way of opening the navigation menu is by `clicking`.

#### Config options

```js
app: {
  sidePanelBehaviour: {
    // you can also enable both.
    click: true,
    hover: false
  }
}
```

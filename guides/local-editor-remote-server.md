# Run a local editor against a remote server

If you don't want to run a Livingdocs server locally, you can also run your editor against a remote server.

Let's assume we have a `staging` environment configured. Run the editor with the respective configuration:
```sh
export ENVIRONMENT=staging
npm start
```

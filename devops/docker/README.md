# Docker

We provide a Docker setup for local development and production deployments.
We recommend to use it, as we will constantly keep it up to date with the application.

Docker files are available in both server and editor, both up- and downstream.
Please consult the boilerplate projects of the [server](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate#livingdocs-server-boilerplate) and the [editor](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor-boilerplate) and check the Dockerfiles.


We also provide several docker images that we use internally and at customers.
To find our docker base images, have a look at the [livingdocsIO/docker repository](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/docker).

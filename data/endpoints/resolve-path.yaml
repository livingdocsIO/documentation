title: Resolve a Path to a Document
description: |
  You need to activate the [Categories]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/categories" >}}) / [Routing]({{< ref "/reference/project-config/content-types#routing" >}}) feature in the Project Config in order to resolve paths to your documents. Routing is a quite advanced topic and the examples only work with a default configuration. Find more [here](/guides/organisation/routing-system/).

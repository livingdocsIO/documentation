title: Authorization
description: |
  To work with the Public API first go to the Project Settings page in the Livingdocs Editor and create an `AccessToken`. The token is scoped to the project so make sure you create the token in the correct project.

  Project admins can create new `AccessToken` by going to `Menu` > `Preferences` > `Project Admin`, from the project landing page.
  On the sidebar, go to `Api Clients` and start the token creation flow with `Add Api Client` on the right.

  In the create token dialog, you can set the name of the token, description (optional), expiration date and permissions. You can click `Create` to generate the token with the chosen permissions. The token will be generated and you can copy it to your clipboard.

  Embed the `AccessToken` in the header of every HTTP request as shown below.

  ##### Base URL
  This is the base Url you will need to interact with our API.

  ```
  https://server.livingdocs.io/
  ```

  ##### Request HTTP headers

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer ey1234
  ```

  ##### Auth Example with Curl

  ```bash
  ACCESS_TOKEN=ey1234
  curl -k -X GET "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/project"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
  ```

  ##### Auth Example with Axios

  ```js
  const axios = require('axios')
  const token = 'ey1234'
  const result = await axios.get('api/v1/project', {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:9090',
    headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`},
    timeout: 20000
  })
  ```
